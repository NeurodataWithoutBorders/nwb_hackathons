## Dates and Location

- **Pre-hackathon project pitch session:** Friday, March 19, 2021, 9am PST (12pm EST)
- **Dates:** Tuesday, March 30, 2021 - Thursday, April 1, 2021, 8am - 3pm PST (11am - 6pm EST)

## Overview

Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) and the DANDI neurophysiology data archive development teams are joining together to create a remote hackathon event for developers. In contrast to the User Days hackathons that focus on training users, this event will focus on bringing together the developers of the NWB data standard, the DANDI development team, and developers of tools in the NWB ecosystem.

This hackathon will enable participants to work intensively on an NWB or DANDI-related project with the assistance of core developers and others in the community. We will share updates with each other on NWB, DANDI, and related community projects. Together, we can develop and discuss ideas for solving technical problems that impact the broader community. Our goal is to foster collaboration and community among developers working on and with NWB and DANDI.

## Registration

Please complete the [registration form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScfZ7ZtO1gN_IZkdhY9kL_FCTTEEJwlpilx4KKrQtRnm2iqrw/viewform?usp=sf_link) to attend the event.

## Logistics

We will be using the Zoom videoconferencing platform for the meeting. We will send an email in the days before the workshop with Zoom links.

It is possible to use Zoom from the browser, but we recommend you install the Zoom app on your computer or phone. See installation instructions [here](https://zoom.us/download).

### Suggested Tracks

- Information standards, Ontologies, NWB extensions
- NWB and/or DANDI-enabled tools
- Contributions to NWB and/or DANDI core software
- Interfacing with data acquisition systems and building tools for data conversion
- Documentation and diagrams


## Objective

The Neurodata Without Borders: Neurophysiology project (NWB, [https://www.nwb.org/](https://www.nwb.org/)) is an effort to standardize the description and storage of neurophysiology data and metadata. NWB enables data sharing and reuse and reduces the energy barrier to applying data analysis both within and across labs. Several laboratories, including the Allen Institute for Brain Science, have wholeheartedly adopted NWB. The community needs to join forces to achieve data standardization in neurophysiology.

The Distributed Archives for Neurophysiology Data Integration (DANDI, [https://www.dandiarchive.org/](https://www.dandiarchive.org/)) is a platform for publishing, sharing, and processing neurophysiology data funded by the BRAIN Initiative. The platform is now available for data upload and distribution. 

The purpose of the NWB+DANDI Developer Hackathon is to bring the neurophysiology developer community together to further the development NWB and DANDI and integration of NWB and DANDI with tools.  Members of the community will work jointly on coding projects, exchange ideas and best practices, surface common needs, resolve coding issues, make feature requests, brainstorm about future collaboration, and make progress on current blockages.
