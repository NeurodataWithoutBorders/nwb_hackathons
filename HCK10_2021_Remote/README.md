## Dates and Location

- **Pre-hackathon project pitch session:** Friday, March 19, 2021, 9am PST (12pm EST)
- **Dates:** Tuesday, March 30, 2021 - Thursday, April 1, 2021, 8am - 3pm PST (11am - 6pm EST)
- **Location:** Anywhere with an internet connection

## Overview

Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) and the DANDI neurophysiology data archive development teams are joining together to create a remote hackathon event for developers. In contrast to the User Days hackathons that focus on training users, this event will focus on bringing together the developers of the NWB data standard, the DANDI development team, and developers of tools in the NWB ecosystem.

This hackathon will enable participants to work intensively on an NWB or DANDI-related project with the assistance of core developers and others in the community. We will share updates with each other on NWB, DANDI, and related community projects. Together, we can develop and discuss ideas for solving technical problems that impact the broader community. Our goal is to foster collaboration and community among developers working on and with NWB and DANDI.

## Registration

Please complete the [registration form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScfZ7ZtO1gN_IZkdhY9kL_FCTTEEJwlpilx4KKrQtRnm2iqrw/viewform?usp=sf_link) to attend the event.

## Logistics

We will be using the [Gather](https://gather.town/) spatial chat platform for most of the meeting. We will be using the [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) videoconferencing platform for the breakout sessions. We will send an email in the week before the workshop with the meeting links.

### Gather Platform

In Gather, you control a video-game-like avatar with your arrow keys. When your avatar is near another attendee's avatar, their video will appear and you will be able to speak with them. This platform allows for many small-group or one-on-one conversations to occur simultaneously and spontaneously. We hope that Gather will emulate the free-flowing social interactions of an in-person hackathon better than having everyone in a single Zoom meeting or messaging over Slack. 

We have a few tips for using Gather, especially if it is your first time:
- Sign in to the space before the meeting and practice using the controls.
- Use a desktop/laptop computer, not a mobile device. Chrome seems to works best. The desktop app also works.
- This is not a 20+ person Zoom call. You can "walk" up to different people and communicate with only the people within a few tiles from your avatar.
- Shaded areas are "private spaces" - only people inside the private space can see and hear you. There are private spaces for each breakout room, each table/desk, and the main stage area.
- While you are hacking, we recommend that you keep Gather open in the background with your speakers/audio on, so that others can more easily reach you. This will help us better emulate an in-person hackathon where everyone is approachable. Feel free to mute yourself and turn off your video when you are not interacting with anyone.
- Click on a name in the People panel (bottom-left button) to send them a message or locate them.
- We recommend keeping the Chat panel open in case someone messages you.
- If you are leaving your computer for a prolonged period, please close the browser to make your avatar leave the space.
- You can click the arrow icon in the top right of the video feed to make everyone’s videos bigger. You can also click your name at the bottom of the screen, User/Video preferences, and Use HD Video Quality for better video.

### Zoom Platform

It is possible to use Zoom from the browser, but we recommend you install the Zoom app on your computer. See installation instructions [here](https://zoom.us/download).

## How to prepare?

If you are not experienced with NWB, please watch this [introduction to NWB](https://training.incf.org/lesson/what-nwb-short-intro-nwb-enabled-tools) and optionally the subsequent lessons in Python (or in MATLAB [here](https://training.incf.org/lesson/what-nwb-short-intro-nwb-enabled-tools-0)).
Install the Python or MATLAB software for NWB:
  * PyNWB (Python): [https://pynwb.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started.html](https://pynwb.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started.html)
  * MatNWB (MATLAB): [https://neurodatawithoutborders.github.io/matnwb/](https://neurodatawithoutborders.github.io/matnwb/)
  
If you are not experienced with DANDI, please read the [DANDI documentation](https://www.dandiarchive.org/handbook/), browse the [DANDI GitHub organization](https://github.com/dandi/), and create an account on [DANDI](https://gui.dandiarchive.org/#/).

## Projects

For instructions on how to create a project see [here](projects/README.md)

{% include_relative projects/PROJECTS.md %}

### Suggested Project Themes

- Information standards, Ontologies, NWB extensions
- NWB and/or DANDI-enabled tools
- Contributions to NWB and/or DANDI core software
- Interfacing with data acquisition systems and building tools for data conversion
- Documentation and diagrams


## Objective

The Neurodata Without Borders: Neurophysiology project (NWB, [https://www.nwb.org/](https://www.nwb.org/)) is an effort to standardize the description and storage of neurophysiology data and metadata. NWB enables data sharing and reuse and reduces the energy barrier to applying data analysis both within and across labs. Several laboratories, including the Allen Institute for Brain Science, have wholeheartedly adopted NWB. The community needs to join forces to achieve data standardization in neurophysiology.

The Distributed Archives for Neurophysiology Data Integration (DANDI, [https://www.dandiarchive.org/](https://www.dandiarchive.org/)) is a platform for publishing, sharing, and processing neurophysiology data funded by the BRAIN Initiative. The platform is now available for data upload and distribution. 

The purpose of the NWB+DANDI Developer Hackathon is to bring the neurophysiology developer community together to further the development NWB and DANDI and integration of NWB and DANDI with tools.  Members of the community will work jointly on coding projects, exchange ideas and best practices, surface common needs, resolve coding issues, make feature requests, brainstorm about future collaboration, and make progress on current blockages.
