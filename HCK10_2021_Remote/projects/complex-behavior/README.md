## Project Description

Write a set of basic neurodata types to cover commonly used behavioral data in novel complex behavioral quantification schemes

## Objectives

1. ndx-labels: both supervised and unsupervised behavioral labels for single- and multi- animal sessions
2. ndx-datatransforms: structuring matrix transformations (PCA, NMF, tSNE, etc.) and metadata
3. ndx-multi: allowing multi-animal coordination of NWB sessions. Likely will be an extension of objects like Subject
