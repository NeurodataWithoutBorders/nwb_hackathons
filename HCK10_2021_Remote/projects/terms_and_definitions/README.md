# Controlled Terms and Definitions for Experimental Metadata in NWB

## Key Investigators

## Project Description

Essential to any data standard is the identification of essential terms for describing entities 
and processes in neurophysiological experiments along with their associated definitions. We are 
seeking input from the community in curating lists of terms for describing their
experimental data and metadata, and refining the definitions of these terms to closer match their 
commonly-accepted use in their respective experimental domains.

## Objectives

<!-- Briefly describe the objectives of your project. What would you like to achive?-->

<!-- 1. Objective A. Describe it in 1-2 sentences.-->
1. Construct and refine lists of controlled terms based on community input.
2. Get feedback on definitions of terms in the curated lists.
3. ... 

## Approach and Plan

We will provide lists of terms in several experimental domains that are under active development as a 
starting point for additions and feedback. We encourage attendees to add new terms and definitions, and 
comment on the terms and definitions already listed. We also encourage attendees to seek out one of 
the project investigators for further discussion on any points of interest.

The areas of interest are:

1. 1D Stimulus waveforms
2. Genotype metadata
3. Spatial coordinates and transforms
4. Behavioral tasks


<!-- 1. Describe the steps of your planned approach to reach the objectives.-->
