#  External Resources and Persistent Identifiers in NWB

**Session Chair: Pamela Baker** ...

As a community standard for ephys data and metadata storage, NWB aims to adhere to the FAIR principles for 
data sharing. Persistent identifiers are a critical component of FAIR datasets, and we have implemented a 
data structure in NWB for storing references to external resources and entities and their associated 
persistent identifiers (eg RRIDs, URIs). Objects and fields within NWB can then be linked to an external
ID and associated information through this External Resources Table. The purpose of this breakout session 
is to present use cases we have developed for testing the functionality of these tables, and to solicit 
feedback and discussion of the use of these tables in NWB, and the handling of 
persistent IDs in NWB (and DANDI) more generally.
