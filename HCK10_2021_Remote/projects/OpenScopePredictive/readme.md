## Project Description

The goal of this project is to convert datasets collected at the Allen Institute, as part of the OpenScope Credit Assignement project into NWB files.
Ultimately we will upload those datasets to Dandihub and check compatibility with scientific analysis code. 

## Objectives

<!-- Briefly describe the objectives of your project. What would you like to achive?-->

 1. Objective A. Convert one experiment into NWB file, including optical physiology and stimulus template
 2. Objective B. Scale up conversion to all experiments and test integrity with DandiHub
 3. Objective C. Test basis analysis code to showcase access to the NWB file within a jupyter notebook online environment. 

## Approach and Plan

<!-- 1. Describe the steps of your planned approach to reach the objectives.-->
