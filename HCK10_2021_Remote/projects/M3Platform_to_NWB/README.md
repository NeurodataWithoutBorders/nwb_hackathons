# Converting Calcium Imaging Data from the M3 Platform to the NWB format.

## Key Investigators

- Kenneth Dyson (Azrieli Centre for Autism Research, McGill University)
- Thomas Gisiger (M3 Research Platform, The Douglas Hospital Research Center)
- Emmanuel Wilson (M3 Research Platform, The Douglas Hospital Research Center)

## Project Description

The M3 Research Platform allows to study the neural underpinnings of behavior by
recording calcium signal with the UCLA miniscope during behaviour activity unfolding in
Bussey-Saksida touchscreen chambers. The resulting raw and preprocessed data can
then be analyzed to interpret neural responses and test hypotheses. In this hackathon,
we want to take the first steps to convert the M3 data in NWB format, and to write
scripts to automate this process.

## Objectives

1. Objective A. Inspect and evaluate to what extent the current NWB format can
completely harbor both the raw and preprocessed data coming from the M3 platform
2. Objective B. Isolate (if any) modifications that should be made to the NWB
format to accomodate the M3 platform data
3. Objective C. Write script for data conversion to the NWB format.

## Approach and Plan

1. Convert to current NWB format a single session preprocessed dataset using the
information currently available in NWB tutorial.
2. Convert to current NWB format a single session raw dataset using the
information currently available in NWB tutorial.
3. Evaluate the success of steps 1 and 2, and (if needed) detect and list NWB changes that
might improve the success of these steps.
4. Communicate the results of the approach to the NWB team and start discussion
on potential improvements needed for the NWB format.
