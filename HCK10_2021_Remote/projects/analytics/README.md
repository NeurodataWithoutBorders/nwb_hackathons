## Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->
Here we will coordinate common and generalizeable analytics that are commonly used on NWB data, for instance:
* SpikeInterface - electrophysiology processing pipelines
* NWBWidgets - interactive visualization of NWB files

## Objectives

<!-- Briefly describe the objectives of your project. What would you like to archive?-->
We will coordinate with each other and ensure that we do not duplicate work and that our solutions interoperate with
 each other intelligently.
