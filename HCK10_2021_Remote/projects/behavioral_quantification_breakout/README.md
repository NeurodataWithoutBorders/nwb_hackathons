#  Coordination for Complex Behavioral Quantification 

**Session Chair:**  Akshay Jaggi

## Participants

Talmo Pereira (Princeton)
Arie Matsliah (Princeton)
Kanishk Jain (Emory)
Jim Bohnslav (Harvard)
Laurel Keyes (Salk)
Jonny Saunders (Oregon)

## Objectives

1. Assess range of NWB needs for diverse behavioral quantification pipelines
2. Identify set of common NWB types useful for all pipelines
3. Discuss long term maintenance / ownership of tools and integration into pipelines
4. Divide up tasks among available workers

## Deliverables

1. ndx-labels: both supervised and unsupervised behavioral labels for single- and multi- animal sessions
2. ndx-datatransforms: structuring matrix transformations (PCA, NMF, tSNE, etc.) and metadata
3. ndx-multi: allowing multi-animal coordination of NWB sessions. Likely will be an extension of objects like Subject

## Approach and Plan

1. Objective 1 (20 min): Open discussion, provide everyone a few minutes to describe their tools and needs 
2. Objective 2 (20 min): Akshay proposes pre-designed plan, discuss feedback and criticism, update plan
3. Objective 3 (10 min): Open discussion about ownership, authority moving forward
4. Objective 4 (10 min): Divy up tasks
