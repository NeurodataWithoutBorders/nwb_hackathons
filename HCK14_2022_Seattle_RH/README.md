## Objective

The DANDI Archive now has 89+ neurophysiology datasets in the NWB format spanning many different species, brain
areas, task types, and imaging modalities. It is now time for us to shift our focus to reanalyzing these datasets.
In this workshop, we will teach attendees about the open neurophysiology datasets available on the DANDI Archive and
train them on how to maximally utilize the archive and the NWB standard to incorporate existing data into their
scientific workflows. This is the first event of its type for NWB, so our team will also be learning
about how we can facilitate data reuse in the neuroscience community.
