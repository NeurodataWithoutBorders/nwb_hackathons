# NWB and DANDI Workshop
### hosted by the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM)

**Dates:** February 19-20, 2025

**Location:** Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Mexico City, Mexico (Room TBD)

**Host:** Dr. Luis Lemus

Join us for an interactive workshop on [Neurodata Without Borders (NWB)](https://nwb.org), a data standard for neurophysiology, and the [DANDI Archive](https://dandiarchive.org), a collaboration platform for publishing, sharing, and processing neurophysiology data. Learn how to use these resources to maximize the impact of your data while complying with the new NIH data sharing and management policies.

## Target Audience
This workshop is designed for neuroscience researchers at all career stages, from undergraduate students working in labs to graduate students, post-doctoral researchers, and principal investigators. No prior programming experience is required.

## Format
This workshop will be held in a hybrid format:
- Day 1 will be available both in-person and remotely via video conference
- Day 2 is an in-person, hands-on session where participants will work with their own data
