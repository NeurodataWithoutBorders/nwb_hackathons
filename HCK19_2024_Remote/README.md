## Logistics

We will be using Gather and Zoom for the meeting and will send an email in the days before the workshop with links.

## Organizing Committee

**Program chair:**  [Steph Prince](https://crd.lbl.gov/divisions/scidata/computational-biosciences/members/staff/stephanie-prince/) and [Oliver Rübel](https://crd.lbl.gov/divisions/scidata/mla/staff/oliver-ruebel/)

## What to bring?

* Please bring any example datasets you would like to convert. For lab-specific data (i.e., data not in these [supported formats](https://nwb-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format_support.html)), you should ideally have scripts for reading the data using Python or MATLAB.
* Bring your laptop with appropriate software installed. For installation instructions see:
  * [**NWB GUIDE**](https://nwb-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)
  * [**PyNWB (Python)**](https://pynwb.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install_users.html)
  * [**MatNWB (Matlab)**](https://neurodatawithoutborders.github.io/matnwb/)
* For an overview of NWB software, see also: 
  * [**Glossary of Core NWB Tools**](https://nwb-overview.readthedocs.io/en/latest/core_tools/core_tools_home.html) 
  * [**Glossary of Analysis and Visualization Tools**](https://nwb-overview.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tools/analysis_tools_home.html)
* For an overview of NWB see the [**NWB Overview Docs**](https://nwb-overview.readthedocs.io)

## Objective

The [Neurodata Without Borders](nwb.org) project is an effort to standardize the description and storage of neurophysiology
data and metadata. NWB enables data sharing and reuse and reduces the energy barrier to applying data analytics both within
and across labs. NWB has seen wide adoption in the neurophysiology community, and there are now over 100 datasets on the
DANDI Archive in NWB, including data from the Allen Institute and the International Brain Laboratory.

The NWB Data Conversion Workshop will train members of the neuroscience community on how to convert their data to NWB and 
publish it on the DANDI Archive. We will train attendees starting from the basics of the NWB format and proceeding to 
domain-specific tutorials and advanced data engineering techniques to maximally utilize the features of the HDF5 and Zarr 
backends. During this workshop, we will introduce multiple sets of tools with varying levels of flexibility for converting
 your data, including NWB GUIDE, a new no-code user interface for data conversion.

**Note:** All levels of experience are welcome! We will have tutorials ranging from no-code, automated data conversion to 
more advanced, custom code conversion.
