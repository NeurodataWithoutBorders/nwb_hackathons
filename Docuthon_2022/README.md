## Objective

The Neurodata Without Borders project (NWB, [https://www.nwb.org/](https://www.nwb.org/)) is an effort to
standardize the description and storage of neurophysiology data and metadata.
NWB enables data sharing and reuse and reduces the energy barrier to applying data analysis both within and across labs.
Several laboratories, including the Allen Institute for Brain Science, have wholeheartedly adopted NWB.
The community needs to join forces to achieve data standardization in neurophysiology.

The purpose of the NWB Docuthon to bring users and developers of the experimental neurophysiology community together to
improve documentation and tutorials for the NWB APIs, schema, and community tools that use NWB.
