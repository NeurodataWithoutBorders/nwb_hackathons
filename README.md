## Introduction

#### What are these hackathons?

The [Neurodata Without Borders][nwb-neurophysiology] (NWB) Hackathon is a hands-on activity lasting several days in which neurophysiology researchers create solutions using the open source NWB software packages.

Participants work collaboratively on solutions that use the NWB unified data format for cellular-based neurophysiology
data, which is focused on the dynamics of groups of neurons measured under a large range of experimental conditions.
In contrast to conferences and workshops where the primary focus is to report results, the objective of the Hackathon
is to provide a venue for creators and users of neurophysiology open-source software to collaboratively work on any
related research projects.

#### Who can attend?

Due to limited space the hackathons participation is currently on an invitation-only basis. If
you are interested in attending a hackathon then please contact the organizer of the hackathon directly. We are
always excited to see new members join the NWB community. One-day participation is permitted for first-time attendees,
but participants are strongly encouraged to stay for the entire event.

#### Who should attend?

This is harder to determine. Your best bet is to contact us (see below) or attend a preparatory
videoconference (see each Hackathon page for details).

#### What is the history of NWB hackathons?

The NWB team consists of neuroscientists and software developers
who recognize that creation and adoption of a unified data format is an important step toward breaking down the
barriers to data sharing in neuroscience. Hackathons are a way for us to collaborate and develop NWB as well
as to engage with the NWB user community.  For an overview of NeurodataWithoutBorders see http://nwb.org/.

As part of the development of NWB 1.x two hackathons were held at Janelia Farm, in Ashburn, Virginia; the first
hackathon  on November 20 â€“ 22, 2014 and the second one on May 14-16 at, 2015 (http://crcns.org/NWB/). As part of
the development of NWB 2.0 a first hackathon was held at Janelia Farm, in Ashburn, Virginia  on July 31 - August 1, 2017.
The primary focus of the first three hackathons has been on development of the NWB format as well as on development of a software strategy for NWB.

To encourage the development, growth and use of NWB as a unified data format for cellular-based neurophysiology
data, the Allen Institute for Brain Science, Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, and Kitware are organizing a
development-focused hackathon at the Allen Institute for Brain Science (April 3-6, 2018) and a user-engagement
and training hackathon at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (April 25-27).
