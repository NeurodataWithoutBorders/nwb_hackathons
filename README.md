## Introduction

#### What?

The [Neurodata Without Borders: Neurophysiology][nwb-neurophysiology] (NWB:N) Hackathon is a hands-on activity lasting several days in which neurophysiology researchers create solutions using the open source NWB:N software packages.

Participants work collaboratively on solutions that use the NWB unified data format for cellular-based neurophysiology
data, which is focused on the dynamics of groups of neurons measured under a large range of experimental conditions.
In contrast to conferences and workshops where the primary focus is to report results, the objective of the Hackathon
is to provide a venue for creators and users of neurophysiology open-source software to collaboratively work on any
related research projects.

#### When, where, how much?

To be determined based on participation. This year there will be a development focused
Hackathon in Early April in Seattle, and then a user on-boarding tutorial Hackathon in late April in Berkeley.
Ad-hoc meetings are added occasionally. We plan to have at least one more Hackathon in 2019. For this first
Hackathon, breakfast and lunch will be covered and there will be no registration fee. These logistics are expected
to evolve with the Hackathons. The [NAMIC Project Week][namic-and-3d-slicer-experience] which has influenced the
NWB Hackathon currently has a registration fee that participants pay, which covers breakfast, lunch, coffee and
snacks during the day.

#### How does it work?

Weekly videoconferences for preparation begin 8-12 weeks before an event (see each Hackathon page for details). Potential participants propose projects during these meetings, and collaboratively create a list of projects that are of mutual interest. The projects include platform work, algorithm development, analytics, visualization, and neurophysiology applications and
research tasks. Projects are not limited to code development, but can include creation of documentation and tutorial
materials.

Through the course of the preparatory meetings, each participant selects one or more project teams and develops goals
for the Hackathon. The first day of the Hackathon itself begins with a 2-hour in-person introduction to all projects
and participants. The rest of the Hackathon consists of a mix of working sessions and breakout sessions on special
topics, as decided by the participants during the preparatory meetings.

The projects should be something that can largely be accomplished in a few days, ideally fun, and can help your lab make progress on your research goals. The projects will be written up at the end in a publicly accessible resource that can be used by the community and can be referenced on grant proposals and reports. Projects could be coding, documentation, or tutorials.

Email announcements are sent to the [Hackathon mailing list][hackathon-mailing-list] (for continuity and permanence
across hackathons), and communication specific to each event will happen on a dedicated Hackathon forum (see each
Hackathon page for details).

#### Who can attend?

Due to limited space the hackathons participation is currently on an invitation-only basis. If
you are interested in attending a hackathon then please contact the organizer of the hackathon directly. We are
always excited to see new members join the NWB:N community. One-day participation is permitted for first-time attendees,
but participants are strongly encouraged to stay for the entire event.

#### Who should attend?

This is harder to determine. Your best bet is to contact us (see below) or attend a preparatory
videoconference (see each Hackathon page for details).

#### What is the history of NWB hackathons?

The NWB:N team consists of neuroscientists and software developers
who recognize that creation and adoption of a unified data format is an important step toward breaking down the
barriers to data sharing in neuroscience. Hackathons are a way for us to collaborate and develop NWB:N as well
as to engage with the NWB:N user community.  For an overview of NeurodataWithoutBorders see http://nwb.org/.

As part of the development of NWB:N 1.x two hackathons were held at Janelia Farm, in Ashburn, Virginia; the first
hackathon  on November 20 â€“ 22, 2014 and the second one on May 14-16 at, 2015 (http://crcns.org/NWB/). As part of
the development of NWB:N 2.0 a first hackathon was held at Janelia Farm, in Ashburn, Virginia  on July 31 - August 1, 2017.
The primary focus of the first three hackathons has been on development of the NWB:N format as well as on development of a software strategy for NWB:N.

To encourage the development, growth and use of NWB:N as a unified data format for cellular-based neurophysiology
data, the Allen Institute for Brain Science, Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, and Kitware are organizing a
development-focused hackathon at the Allen Institute for Brain Science (April 3-6, 2018) and a user-engagement
and training hackathon at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (April 25-27).
