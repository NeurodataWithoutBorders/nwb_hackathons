## About NWB hackathons

###  What are hackathons?

The [Neurodata Without Borders][nwb-neurophysiology] (NWB) hackathons are a hands-on activity lasting several days in which neurophysiology researchers create solutions using the open source NWB software packages.

Participants work collaboratively on solutions that use the NWB unified data format for cellular-based neurophysiology
data, which is focused on the dynamics of groups of neurons measured under a large range of experimental conditions.
In contrast to conferences and workshops where the primary focus is to report results, the objective of the Hackathon
is to provide a venue for creators and users of neurophysiology open-source software to collaboratively work on any
related research projects.

### What are the different types of hackathons?

Over the course of the NWB endeavour, the NWB team has created a range of different hackathon
events to address different needs:

- **NeurodataReHack** focused on training and project to generate new insights from existing
  neurophysiology data through secondary analysis
- **User Days** focused on training and engagement with the NWB user community and integration
  of data and lab processes with NWB.
- **Developer Days** focused on engagement with the broader developer community and on
  integration and development of NWB enabled tools and core software.
- **Docathon** focused on enhancing documentation for NWB and associated software
- **NWB Core Hackathons:** These hackathons focus on development of the core NWB data standard
  and software. This includes in particular the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd hackathon.


### What is the history of NWB hackathons?

The NWB team consists of neuroscientists and software developers
who recognize that creation and adoption of a unified data format is an important step toward breaking down the
barriers to data sharing in neuroscience. Hackathons are a way for us to collaborate and develop NWB as well
as to engage with the NWB user community.  For an overview of NeurodataWithoutBorders see http://nwb.org/.

As part of the development of NWB 1.x two hackathons were held at Janelia Farm, in Ashburn, Virginia; the first
hackathon  on November 20 â€“ 22, 2014 and the second one on May 14-16 at, 2015 (http://crcns.org/NWB/). As part of
the development of NWB 2.0 a first hackathon was held at Janelia Farm, in Ashburn, Virginia  on July 31 - August 1, 2017.
The primary focus of the first three hackathons has been on development of the NWB format as well as on development of a software strategy for NWB.

To encourage the development, growth and use of NWB as a unified data format for cellular-based neurophysiology
data, the Allen Institute for Brain Science, Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, and Kitware are organizing a
development-focused hackathon at the Allen Institute for Brain Science (April 3-6, 2018) and a user-engagement
and training hackathon at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (April 25-27).
