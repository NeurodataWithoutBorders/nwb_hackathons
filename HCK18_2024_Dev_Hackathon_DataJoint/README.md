## Report

The final report for the 2024 NWB Developer Hackathon is now available on GitHub ([PDF](report/Report_18th_NWB_Developer_Hackathon.pdf)) ([LaTeX (on Overleaf)](https://www.overleaf.com/read/zcdnqtcmwgpv#d964cb)).

## Overview

The Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) team is organizing a hackathon event for developers.
In contrast to our NWB user training workshops, this event is focused on bringing together the developers of the
NWB data standard and software ecosystem and developers of community tools who would like to integrate their tools
with NWB. This hackathon will enable participants to work intensively on an NWB-related project with the assistance of
the NWB development team and others in the community. Together, we can develop and discuss ideas for solving technical
problems that impact the broader community. Our goal is to foster collaboration and community among developers.

This is our first NWB hackathon event hosted by DataJoint. Working in the DataJoint building and with their team will facilitate projects at the intersection between DataJoint and NWB, such as Spyglass or building NWB export for custom DataJoint pipelines. We also welcome NWB projects that are not related to DataJoint.

## Dates and Location

- **Dates:** Wednesday, April 17, 2024, 9 AM to Friday, April 19, 2024, 5:30 PM
- **Location:** DataJoint headquarters, [4265 San Felipe St #1025, Houston, TX 77027](https://www.google.com/maps/place/4265+San+Felipe+St+%231025,+Houston,+TX+77027/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x8640c15d907d761d:0x38a7f7a077419384?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwih_8ykk_GAAxVzEEQIHb_sBvIQ8gF6BAgcEAA&ved=2ahUKEwih_8ykk_GAAxVzEEQIHb_sBvIQ8gF6BAgdEAI)

We encourage participants to stay at the hackathon until Friday at 5:30 PM to participate in the final project presentations.

Immediately prior to the NWB Developer Hackathon, DataJoint will be organizing the SciOps Summit 2024 at the same location.
If you are interested in this DataJoint event, we encourage you to register for it as well.

DataJoint will also be organizing a social mixer event on Tuesday, April 16 at 5:30 PM
for DataJoint workshop participants to mix with NWB Developer Hackathon participants. We encourage participants to arrive early
enough on Tuesday to attend this mixer.

You can start attending the event(s) on different days for different experiences:

- NWB Developer Hackathon only: Join Wednesday to Friday
- SciOps Summit 2024 and NWB Developer Hackathon: Join Monday to Friday

## Organizing Committee

**Site Chair:** Kushal Bakshi

**Program chairs:** [Ryan Ly](https://crd.lbl.gov/divisions/scidata/mla/staff/ryan-ly/) and [Ben Dichter](http://bendichter.com/)


## Objective

The [Neurodata Without Borders](https://www.nwb.org/) project is an effort to standardize the description and storage of neurophysiology data and metadata. NWB enables data sharing and reuse and reduces the energy barrier to applying data analytics both within and across labs. NWB has seen wide adoption in the neurophysiology community, and there are now over 175 datasets on the DANDI Archive in NWB, including data from the Allen Institute and the International Brain Laboratory.

The NWB Developer Hackathon will bring neuroscientists, tool builders, and research software engineers together to further the development of the NWB software ecosystem, including the data standard, core software packages, official tools, and community tools. Members of the community will exchange ideas and best practices for using NWB and the libraries, share NWB based tools, surface common needs, solve bugs, make feature requests, brainstorm about future funding and collaboration, and make progress on current blockages.

**Note:** This event is meant to foster community and collaboration around NWB, not competition. As such, this is really more of a “workshop” than a “hackathon.” There will be no judges or prizes. Participants will be expected to bring their own software tool or data, other relevant project, and/or collaborate with others to build integration with NWB.
