The objective of the event is to bring the neurophysiology data and standards developer community together to evaluate the use of LinkML to create common schema and facilitate integration of data across standards and resources. The goal is to create LinkML based schemas that integrate information across existing efforts in data modeling for neuroscience and leveraging existing standards and resources, e.g, NWB, AIND, OpenMINDS, DANDI, and BICAN. To support large scientific data, a second goal is to extend LinkML for array type data structures required, e.g, for NWB and OME-Zarr. This is an invitation-only event.

## Logistics

### Directions
 - **ICSI (Main Event):** ICSI is located in Downtown Berkeley across from the Downtown Berkeley BART station (on the second floor above the CHASE bank), with convenient access to hotels, restaurants, and transit. BART will conveniently get you from the airport to ICSI:
     - **From San Francisco International Airport** Depending on the time you can either take: 1) the Richmond (red) train directly to the Downtown Berkeley station, or 2) the Antioch (yellow) train to 19th Street Oakland and transfer to the Richmond (orange) line (across the platform) to Downtown Berkeley. Transfer time with BART is ~54min.
     - **From Oakland International Airport** Take the BART connector train from the Airport to the Oakland Coliseum station and transfer to the Richmond (orange) train to Downtown Berkeley BART station.
