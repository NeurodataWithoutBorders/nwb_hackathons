## Dates and Location

- **Dates:** July 8-12, 2024
- **Location:** [HHMI Janelia Research Campus](https://www.janelia.org/), 19700 Helix Dr, Ashburn, VA 20147,
  [Openstreetmap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=39.0708&mlon=-77.4655#map=14/39.0708/-77.4655)
  [Directions](https://www.janelia.org/directions)

## Objective
[The DANDI Archive](http://dandiarchive.org) now has 199+ neurophysiology datasets in the 
[Neurodata Without Borders](http://nwb.org) format  spanning many species, brain  areas, task types, and imaging 
modalities. These include high-value datasets, e.g. from [Allen Institute OpenScope](https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/search?search=openscope), the [MICrONS project](https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/000402), and the 
[International Brain Laboratory Brain Wide Map](https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/000409), as well as diverse contributions from neuroscience labs around the world. In this 
workshop, we will teach attendees about the open neurophysiology datasets available on the DANDI Archive and train 
them on how to maximally utilize the archive and the NWB standard to incorporate existing data into their scientific 
workflows. Feedback from attendees will be used to improve the software and data standard to better enable 
reanalysis workflows.


Prior to the workshop, we are organizing [Open Neurodata Showcase](../HCK20_2024_OpenNeurodataShowcase/README.md) where attendees can meet the contributors behind the neurophysiology datasets and explore virtual posters. Visit the [event page](../HCK20_2024_OpenNeurodataShowcase/README.md#application) to sign up
and read more about this feature event.


Example projects include but are not limited to:
* Determine whether your result is present in another species or brain area.
* Showcase the capabilities of your tool or analysis on existing data from another lab.
* Explore follow-up questions to a study.
* Create educational content that uses open data.

<!-- 
Following the event, participants will be invited to apply for a Kavli Foundation Neurodata Discovery Award, which 
awards $50,000 (USD) of funding to continue data reanalysis projects that come out of the NeuroDataReHack event. Details about the Kavli Foundation Neurodata Discovery Award will be provided closer to the event.
-->
This event will primarily focus on analyzing existing data in NWB and on DANDI, **not** converting data to NWB. If 
you are interested in learning how to convert data, consider signing up for an NWB User Days event.

<!-- 
## Eligibility

This course is intended for PhD students, postdoctoral researchers, principal investigators, or similar.
