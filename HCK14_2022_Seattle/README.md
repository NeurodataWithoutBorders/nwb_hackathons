## What to bring?

* Create the outline for your project at the hackathon. For further details and instructions on how to create a project, see [here](projects/README.md)
* Bring your laptop with appropriate software installed. For instructions on how to install PyNWB, see [the PyNWB documentation](http://pynwb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#installation).

## Objective

The DANDI Archive now has 80+ neurophysiology datasets in the NWB format spanning many different species, brain 
areas, task types, and imaging modalities. It is now time for us to shift our focus to reanalyzing these datasets. 
In this workshop, we will teach attendees about the open neurophysiology datasets available on the DANDI Archive and 
train them on how to maximally utilize the archive and the NWB standard to incorporate existing data into their 
scientific workflows. This is the first event of its type for NWB, so our team will also be learning 
about how we can facilitate data reuse in the neuroscience community.
