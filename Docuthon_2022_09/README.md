[//]: # (Let us know about your experience with the NWB documentation and on how we can improve your experience with NWB by completing the [NWB Documentation Survey]&#40;https://forms.gle/TadZBRKJpwEWeErv8&#41;. Please complete the survey even if you are unable to participate in the Docathon. The survey is a great way to give back by helping us better understand your experience with the NWB documentation.)

## Dates and Location

- **Dates:** September 22-23, 2022
- **Location:** Anywhere with an internet connection

## Overview

The workshop will focus primarily on improving documentation and tutorials for the NWB APIs, schema, and community
tools that use NWB.

## Registration

Please complete the [registration form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdFC77E1H0xF1i2LShdCkzZYXH9TqZhwwksZpWSvwd_nTnRyA/viewform?usp=sf_link) to attend the event. 

[//]: # (In addition, please also consider participating in the [NWB Documentation Survey]&#40;https://forms.gle/TadZBRKJpwEWeErv8&#41; to help us prepare for the event and help us improve our documentation.)

## Logistics

We will be using the [Gather](https://gather.town/) spatial chat platform for most of the meeting. We will be using the [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) videoconferencing platform for the breakout sessions. We will send an email in the week before the workshop with the meeting links.

### Gather Platform

In Gather, you control a video-game-like avatar with your arrow keys. When your avatar is near another attendee's avatar, their video will appear and you will be able to speak with them. This platform allows for many small-group or one-on-one conversations to occur simultaneously and spontaneously. We hope that Gather will emulate the free-flowing social interactions of an in-person hackathon better than having everyone in a single Zoom meeting or messaging over Slack.

We have a few tips for using Gather, especially if it is your first time:
- Sign in to the space before the meeting and practice using the controls.
- Use a **desktop/laptop computer**, not a mobile device. Chrome seems to works best. The desktop app also works.
- This is not a 20+ person Zoom call. You can "walk" up to different people and communicate with only the people within a few tiles from your avatar.
- **Shaded areas are "private spaces" - only people inside the private space can see and hear you.** There are private spaces for each breakout room, each table/desk, and the main stage area.
- While you are hacking, we recommend that you **keep Gather open in the background with your speakers/audio on**, so that others can more easily reach you. This will help us better emulate an in-person hackathon where everyone is approachable. Feel free to mute yourself and turn off your video when you are not interacting with anyone.
- Click on a name in the People panel (bottom-left button) to send them a message or locate them.
- We recommend that you **keep the Chat panel on the left open in case someone messages you**.
- If you are leaving your computer for a prolonged period, please close the browser to make your avatar leave the space.
- You can click the arrow icon in the top right of the video feed to make everyone’s videos bigger. You can also click your name at the bottom of the screen, User/Video preferences, and Use HD Video Quality for better video.

### Zoom Platform

It is possible to use Zoom from the browser, but we recommend you install the Zoom app on your computer. See installation instructions [here](https://zoom.us/download).

## Organizing Committee

**Program chairs:**  Oliver Ruebel, Benjamin Dichter, Ryan Ly, and Matthew Avaylon

Additional organizational support is provided by the Kavli Foundation.

  * MatNWB (MATLAB): [https://neurodatawithoutborders.github.io/matnwb/#setup](https://neurodatawithoutborders.github.io/matnwb/#setup)

## Projects

If you have a specific project you would like to work on, please add it to [this google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t2eREXYwakBt5Dd4pnuzKBL8dPZJc2FsK0wZ_Xj7DNk/edit#).


## Objective

The Neurodata Without Borders project (NWB, [https://www.nwb.org/](https://www.nwb.org/)) is an effort to
standardize the description and storage of neurophysiology data and metadata.
NWB enables data sharing and reuse and reduces the energy barrier to applying data analysis both within and across labs.
Several laboratories, including the Allen Institute for Brain Science, have wholeheartedly adopted NWB.
The community needs to join forces to achieve data standardization in neurophysiology.

The purpose of the NWB Docathon to bring users and developers of the experimental neurophysiology community together to
improve documentation and tutorials for the NWB APIs, schema, and community tools that use NWB.

Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any event venue, including talks. event participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event without a refund at the discretion of the event organizers.

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion.

Event organisers may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for any participants.

If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, event organisers have the responsibility to remind the offender about our Code of Conduct, and warn them that repeated inappropriate, uncivil, threatening, offensive, or harmful behavior can lead to a temporary or permanent ban from the event with no refund.
