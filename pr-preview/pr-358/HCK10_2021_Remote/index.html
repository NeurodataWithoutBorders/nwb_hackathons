<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) and the DANDI neurophysiology data archive development teams are joining together to create a remote hackathon event for developers. In contrast to the User Days hackathons that focus on training users, this event will focus on bringing together the developers of the NWB data standard, the DANDI development team, and developers of tools in the NWB ecosystem.</p>

<p>This hackathon will enable participants to work intensively on an NWB or DANDI-related project with the assistance of core developers and others in the community. We will share updates with each other on NWB, DANDI, and related community projects. Together, we can develop and discuss ideas for solving technical problems that impact the broader community. Our goal is to foster collaboration and community among developers working on and with NWB and DANDI.</p>

<h2 id="registration">Registration</h2>

<p>Please complete the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScfZ7ZtO1gN_IZkdhY9kL_FCTTEEJwlpilx4KKrQtRnm2iqrw/viewform?usp=sf_link">registration form</a> to attend the event.</p>

<h2 id="logistics">Logistics</h2>

<p>We will be using the <a href="https://gather.town/">Gather</a> spatial chat platform for most of the meeting. We will be using the <a href="https://zoom.us/">Zoom</a> videoconferencing platform for the breakout sessions. We will send an email in the week before the workshop with the meeting links.</p>

<h3 id="gather-platform">Gather Platform</h3>

<p>In Gather, you control a video-game-like avatar with your arrow keys. When your avatar is near another attendee’s avatar, their video will appear and you will be able to speak with them. This platform allows for many small-group or one-on-one conversations to occur simultaneously and spontaneously. We hope that Gather will emulate the free-flowing social interactions of an in-person hackathon better than having everyone in a single Zoom meeting or messaging over Slack.</p>

<p>We have a few tips for using Gather, especially if it is your first time:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sign in to the space before the meeting and practice using the controls.</li>
  <li>Use a <strong>desktop/laptop computer</strong>, not a mobile device. Chrome seems to works best. The desktop app also works.</li>
  <li>This is not a 20+ person Zoom call. You can “walk” up to different people and communicate with only the people within a few tiles from your avatar.</li>
  <li><strong>Shaded areas are “private spaces” - only people inside the private space can see and hear you.</strong> There are private spaces for each breakout room, each table/desk, and the main stage area.</li>
  <li>While you are hacking, we recommend that you <strong>keep Gather open in the background with your speakers/audio on</strong>, so that others can more easily reach you. This will help us better emulate an in-person hackathon where everyone is approachable. Feel free to mute yourself and turn off your video when you are not interacting with anyone.</li>
  <li>Click on a name in the People panel (bottom-left button) to send them a message or locate them.</li>
  <li>We recommend that you <strong>keep the Chat panel on the left open in case someone messages you</strong>.</li>
  <li>If you are leaving your computer for a prolonged period, please close the browser to make your avatar leave the space.</li>
  <li>You can click the arrow icon in the top right of the video feed to make everyone’s videos bigger. You can also click your name at the bottom of the screen, User/Video preferences, and Use HD Video Quality for better video.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="zoom-platform">Zoom Platform</h3>

<p>It is possible to use Zoom from the browser, but we recommend you install the Zoom app on your computer. See installation instructions <a href="https://zoom.us/download">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="proposing-breakout-sessions">Proposing breakout sessions</h3>

<p>To propose additional breakout sessions, please contact the hackathon organizing team.</p>

<h2 id="matchmaking-chat">Matchmaking Chat</h2>

<p>Successful collaborations often begin from casual social interactions. To facilitate networking and social interactions during the hackathon, we will have a session of 2 one-on-one 15-minute chats between participants. Please fill out the form you received by email to let us know your interests, and we will pair you up during the hackathon.</p>

<p>Prior to the chat, please take a quick look at your partner’s webpage or list of publications (a link will be included in the email we send you), but there is no expectation that you will read their papers. Please also think about how to quickly describe your research interests bearing in mind your partner’s background.</p>

<p>During the chat, we recommend the following, but feel free to structure your meeting however you like.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Start by each of you talking for 1 - 2 minutes about your general interests and approach.</li>
  <li>If you immediately see a point of connection, go for it and talk about that.</li>
  <li>Feel free to use screen-sharing and your slides if you think they help.</li>
  <li>If not, try each of you describing briefly one or two projects that you think would be relevant or interesting to the other one, and see if that sparks an interesting discussion.</li>
  <li>Keep in mind, the idea is to give yourselves the best chance of finding an unexpected and useful connection, so think broadly and try to get across a range of ideas until you find something that gets you both excited that you can talk about in more detail.</li>
  <li>Please be kind and respectful during your meeting (see more on our code of conduct page).</li>
  <li>Don’t worry if you don’t find something, our algorithms aren’t perfect and you’re not being judged on how well you do - have fun!</li>
</ul>

<p>These tips are largely adapted from the <a href="https://neuromatch.io/instructions/how-to-register/">successful mindmatching from the neuromatch conference</a>. See also this <a href="https://elifesciences.org/labs/5ed408f4/neuromatch-algorithms-to-match-scientists">paper</a> on the format and a matching algorithm.</p>

<h2 id="objective">Objective</h2>

<p>The Neurodata Without Borders: Neurophysiology project (NWB, <a href="https://www.nwb.org/">https://www.nwb.org/</a>) is an effort to standardize the description and storage of neurophysiology data and metadata. NWB enables data sharing and reuse and reduces the energy barrier to applying data analysis both within and across labs. Several laboratories, including the Allen Institute for Brain Science, have wholeheartedly adopted NWB. The community needs to join forces to achieve data standardization in neurophysiology.</p>

<p>The Distributed Archives for Neurophysiology Data Integration (DANDI, <a href="https://www.dandiarchive.org/">https://www.dandiarchive.org/</a>) is a platform for publishing, sharing, and processing neurophysiology data funded by the BRAIN Initiative. The platform is now available for data upload and distribution.</p>

<p>The purpose of the NWB+DANDI Developer Hackathon is to bring the neurophysiology developer community together to further the development NWB and DANDI and integration of NWB and DANDI with tools.  Members of the community will work jointly on coding projects, exchange ideas and best practices, surface common needs, resolve coding issues, make feature requests, brainstorm about future collaboration, and make progress on current blockages.</p>
