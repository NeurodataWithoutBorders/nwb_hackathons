# Intracellular Ephys Stimulus Description and Ontology

## Key Investigators

- Patrick Ray, AIBS
- Pamela Baker, AIBS

- Oliver Ruebel, LBNL


## Project Description

As members of the INCF working group on ephys stimulation ontology, we have developed an ontology 
for describing 1-dimensional waveforms that are
used a stimuli for intracellular patch clamp experiments. We have prototyped an extension to the
NWB schema for building a 
Stimulus Function Table in NWB for storing parameterized waveform descriptions, and 
linking the terms in the table to the stimulus ontology (see External Resources breakout session for 
more detail). For this project we are soliciting feedback 
from the community on the utility and completeness of these descriptions. As well, we will be working on 
integrating these stimulus descriptions with the hierarchical organization for IC ephys experiments
that is also under development (see Oliver's project).
