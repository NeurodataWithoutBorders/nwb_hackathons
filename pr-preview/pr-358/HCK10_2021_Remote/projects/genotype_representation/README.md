# Genotype representation in NWB

## Key Investigators

- Ryan Ly (LBNL)
- Oliver Ruebel (LBNL)
- Lydia Ng (Allen Institute)
- Pamela Baker (Allen Institute)
- Ben Dichter (LBNL, CatalystNeuro) 

## Project Description

Discuss and improve an extension to NWB to represent genotype information in a standardized format. A working group for this topic has met and discussed this several times before and a draft of the extension has been created (see notes in Background section). The draft needs to be updated to use the latest ontology structures in HDMF, and the revised extension needs to be tested against a variety of use cases from the community, e.g., from the Allen Institute and using existing NWB files in which genotype information was stored in alternate, custom formats.
