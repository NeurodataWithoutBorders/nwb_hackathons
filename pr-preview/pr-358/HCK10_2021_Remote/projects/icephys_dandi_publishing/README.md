# Publishing IC ephys data on DANDI

## Key Investigators

Shreejoy Tripathy, CAMH

## Project Description

Publishing a set of intracellular ephys experiments converted from abf to NWB format to DANDI. 

## Objectives

- Document and describe the conversion process going from experimental data collection in .abf format to NWB
- Publish a preliminary version of the dataset
- Learn how to update datasets on DANDI

## Approach and Plan

- Think about grouping individual recordings/traces by experimental conditions (currently, each .abf file is converted to a single NWB file)

## Progress and Next Steps
