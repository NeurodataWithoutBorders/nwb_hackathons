# User Training and Use Cases

## Key Investigators

- Oliver Ruebel (LBNL)
- Andrew Tritt (LBNL)
- Ben Dichter (Stanford)
- Nicholas Cain (Allen Institute for Brain Science)

## Project Description

The goal of this project is 1) to conduct new user training and 2) to interact with 
attendees on their use cases to identify needs for NWB:N.

## Objectives

<!-- Briefly describe the objectives of your project. What would you like to achive?-->

1. Assist hackathon participants with their NWB:N and PyNWB hackathon projects
2. Collect use cases from the participants to help inform NWB:N development
3. Work with participants to identify problems and needs with regard to PyNWB

## Approach and Plan

1. Present tutorials
1. Engage with attendees in one-on-one conversations about their projects
1. Assist attendees with questions and facilitate the project hacking sessions

## Progress and Next Steps

## Background and References

The Neurodata Without Borders: Neurophysiology ("NWB") format is designed to store a 
variety of neurophysiology data, including from intracellular and extracellular 
electrophysiology experiments, optical physiology experiments, as well as tracking 
and stimulus data.
