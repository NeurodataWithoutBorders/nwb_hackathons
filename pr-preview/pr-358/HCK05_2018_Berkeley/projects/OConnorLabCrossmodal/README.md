## Project Description

Conversion of extracellular electrophysiology data from our crossmodal attention project to the NWB:N format

## Objectives

<!-- Briefly describe the objectives of your project. What would you like to achive?-->

Objective A. Load raw extracellular recordings collected using tetrodes + Intan system into NWB file.  
Objective B. Load processed/spike sorted data into NWB file.  
Objective C. Reproduce analysis using new NWB files as starting points.
