# NWB Camera Capture code

## Key Investigators

* Jochen Weber (Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Columbia University)
* David Nicholas (Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Columbia University)

## Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->
This project will investigate the use of the NWB framework to compile data from multiple 
sources and formats into a single NWB file. This data includes intrinsic and fluorescent
wide-field images from awake behaving mice, as well as behavioral webcam images to 
accompany it. We hope to construct an NWB file, import the data into the file, and then read
it into a matlab workspace for later analysis.

## Objectives

<!-- Briefly describe the objectives of your project. What would you like to achive?-->

1. Investigate how the NWB:N framework can be applied for storing frame-by-frame image
   data and already constructed mat files. Using the Python NWB:N interface, construct 
   an NWB file and store all data types and metadata into the file.
   
2. As a proof-of-concept, we wish to then write a matlab script that reads the NWB file
   containing the captured frames, associated wide field data, and metadata.
