## Logistics

###  Hotel

- **Hotel:** A block of 15 rooms has been reserved at the [LBNL Guest House](http://www.berkeleylabguesthouse.org/) for this event for April 25-27. For details on how to reserve your room see [here](travel/lbnl_guest_house_information.pdf). Availability of rooms is limited. Please reserve your room 30 days prior to arrival.

- **Alternate Hotels:** LBNL operates a shuttle service from Downtown Berkeley to LBNL. Alternate hotels in Berkeley near LBNL shuttle stops are e.g.:

   * [Downtown Berkeley Inn](http://www.downtownberkeleyinn.com/)
   * [UC Berkeley Faculty Club](https://www.berkeleyfacultyclub.com/)

### Transportation

Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) is located in Berkeley on the hillside directly above the campus of the University of California at Berkeley. The Labs address is 1 Cyclotron Road, Berkeley CA 94720. To make LBNL easily accessible, the Lab has its own shuttle service that takes people around the site and to downtown Berkeley and the BART station there. 

  - **Getting to LBNL:** Detailed instructions for how to get to the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory campus from the San Francisco Internal Ariport and the Oakland Internal Airport are available [here](http://www2.lbl.gov/Workplace/Transportation.html).

  - **LBNL Shuttle:** The LBNL Shuttle service is available to all attendees. For a detailed schedule and routes see [here](http://www2.lbl.gov/Workplace/Facilities/Support/Busses/all_routes.html). Building 59 is located near the Building 65 shuttle stop. As a visitor you will need your photo ID and a visitor bus pass, email, or permission from Lab host, written on official letterhead. TIP: When you see a shuttle bus approaching WAVE AT THE DRIVER so the driver knows you want to board the bus. LBNL shuttle stops are marked with this sign:
  
  <img alt="Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Guest House Location" src="http://www2.lbl.gov/Workplace/Facilities/Support/Busses/assets/img/bus-logo.gif" height="110" hspace="35"> 

  - **Car:** Parking is available to all guests of the LBNL Guest House. Guest house parking is located directly across from the LBNL guest house (Parking Lot **Z** in the below map). For attendees staying at offsite locations, parking spaces are difficult to find at LBNL and if you need to park onsite then additional reserved parking must be requested 2 weeks ahead of the meeting.

 - **LBNL Campus Maps:** Maps of the LBNL campus are availble online in various formats:
 
   - [Static online map](http://www2.lbl.gov/Workplace/lab-site-map.html)
   - [Interactive online map](http://map.lbl.gov/#UMAP_2012091840117)

## What to bring?

* Create the outline for your project at the hackathon. For further details and instructions on how to create a project see [here](projects/README.md)
* Bring any example data sets needed for your project with you to the hackathon. For any lab-specific data (i.e., data not in NWB:N) you should know how to read the data using Python and ideally have scripts ready for reading the data.  
* Bring your labtop with appropriate software installed. For instructions on how to install PyNWB see [http://pynwb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#installation](http://pynwb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#installation)
* For an overview of NWB:N see also: [https://neurodatawithoutborders.github.io/](https://neurodatawithoutborders.github.io/)

## Objective

The Neurodata Without Borders: Neurophysiology project (NWB:N, www.nwb.org) is an effort to standardize the description and storage of neurophysiology data and metadata. NWB:N enables data sharing/reuse and reduces the energy-barrier to applying data analytics both within and across labs. Several laboratories, including the Allen Institute for Brain Science, have wholeheartedly adopted NWB:N. The community needs to join forces to achieve data standardization in neurophysiology. This hackathon event invites experts from the neuroscience community to explore adopting NWB:N for their data sharing needs and lab use cases. The goal of this event is to a) train new users on NWB:N, b) promote adoption of NWB:N, c) work with users on programming projects, e.g, to integrate examples of their labs data into NWB:N, d) facilitate communication between users and developers and project teams, and e) engage with the community.
