# OpticalVoltagetoNWB

## Key Investigators

Jeremy Forest (New York University & Columbia University)

## Project Description

The purpose of this project is to code the pipeline allowing to transform raw image data from whole optical experiments using voltage sensors to NWB format for ease of use, share and storage.

## Objectives

1. Store raw data as NWB format.
2. Store subregions (ROI) data.
3. Store preprocessing steps (dF/F0, background substraction ...).

## Approach and Plan
1. Understand the inner working of NWB format and define which metadata to store along raw data. Code raw data storage implementation.
2. Modify already implemented preprocessing pipeline to convert ROI data in NWB format and store alongside raw data.
3. Store preprocessing steps data in NWB format alongside 1 and 2 data.
