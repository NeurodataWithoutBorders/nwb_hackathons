<h2 id="dates-and-location">Dates and Location</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Dates:</strong> September 22-23, 2022</li>
  <li>
<strong>Location:</strong> Anywhere with an internet connection</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>The workshop will focus primarily on improving documentation and tutorials for the NWB APIs, schema, and community
tools that use NWB.</p>

<h2 id="registration">Registration</h2>

<p>Please complete the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdFC77E1H0xF1i2LShdCkzZYXH9TqZhwwksZpWSvwd_nTnRyA/viewform?usp=sf_link">registration form</a> to attend the event.</p>

<h2 id="logistics">Logistics</h2>

<p>We will be using the <a href="https://gather.town/">Gather</a> spatial chat platform for most of the meeting. We will be using the <a href="https://zoom.us/">Zoom</a> videoconferencing platform for the breakout sessions. We will send an email in the week before the workshop with the meeting links.</p>

<h3 id="gather-platform">Gather Platform</h3>

<p>In Gather, you control a video-game-like avatar with your arrow keys. When your avatar is near another attendee’s avatar, their video will appear and you will be able to speak with them. This platform allows for many small-group or one-on-one conversations to occur simultaneously and spontaneously. We hope that Gather will emulate the free-flowing social interactions of an in-person hackathon better than having everyone in a single Zoom meeting or messaging over Slack.</p>

<p>We have a few tips for using Gather, especially if it is your first time:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sign in to the space before the meeting and practice using the controls.</li>
  <li>Use a <strong>desktop/laptop computer</strong>, not a mobile device. Chrome seems to works best. The desktop app also works.</li>
  <li>This is not a 20+ person Zoom call. You can “walk” up to different people and communicate with only the people within a few tiles from your avatar.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Shaded areas are “private spaces” - only people inside the private space can see and hear you.</strong> There are private spaces for each breakout room, each table/desk, and the main stage area.</li>
  <li>While you are hacking, we recommend that you <strong>keep Gather open in the background with your speakers/audio on</strong>, so that others can more easily reach you. This will help us better emulate an in-person hackathon where everyone is approachable. Feel free to mute yourself and turn off your video when you are not interacting with anyone.</li>
  <li>Click on a name in the People panel (bottom-left button) to send them a message or locate them.</li>
  <li>We recommend that you <strong>keep the Chat panel on the left open in case someone messages you</strong>.</li>
  <li>If you are leaving your computer for a prolonged period, please close the browser to make your avatar leave the space.</li>
  <li>You can click the arrow icon in the top right of the video feed to make everyone’s videos bigger. You can also click your name at the bottom of the screen, User/Video preferences, and Use HD Video Quality for better video.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="zoom-platform">Zoom Platform</h3>

<p>It is possible to use Zoom from the browser, but we recommend you install the Zoom app on your computer. See installation instructions <a href="https://zoom.us/download">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="organizing-committee">Organizing Committee</h2>

<p><strong>Program chairs:</strong>  Oliver Ruebel, Benjamin Dichter, Ryan Ly, and Matthew Avaylon</p>

<h2 id="objective">Objective</h2>

<p>The Neurodata Without Borders project (NWB, <a href="https://www.nwb.org/">https://www.nwb.org/</a>) is an effort to
standardize the description and storage of neurophysiology data and metadata.
NWB enables data sharing and reuse and reduces the energy barrier to applying data analysis both within and across labs.
Several laboratories, including the Allen Institute for Brain Science, have wholeheartedly adopted NWB.
The community needs to join forces to achieve data standardization in neurophysiology.</p>

<p>The purpose of the NWB Docathon to bring users and developers of the experimental neurophysiology community together to
improve documentation and tutorials for the NWB APIs, schema, and community tools that use NWB.</p>

<h2 id="agenda">Agenda</h2>

<p><strong>All times are in Pacific Standard Time (PST; UTC-8)</strong></p>

<p><strong>All breakout sessions will be held in Room 1 of the Gather space unless noted otherwise.</strong></p>
