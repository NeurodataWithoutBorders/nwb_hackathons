# Welcome to the NWB:N Tutorial at Cosyne 2019!

The [Neurodata Without Borders: Neurophysiology (NWB:N)](https://neurodatawithoutborders.github.io/) team is holding a tutorial on the NWB:N data standard and on using [PyNWB](https://neurodatawithoutborders.github.io/pynwb) and [MatNWB](https://neurodatawithoutborders.github.io/matnwbemb) at the Cosyne 2019 Workshops.

 The [NWB:N project](https://neurodatawithoutborders.github.io/) is an effort to standardize the description and storage of neurophysiology data and metadata. NWB:N enables data sharing and reuse and reduces the energy-barrier to applying data analytics both within and across labs. NWB:N is more than just a file format but it defines an [ecosystem](https://neurodatawithoutborders.github.io/overview) of tools, methods, and standards for storing, sharing, and analyzing complex neurophysiology data.

 We recently released [NWB:N 2.0](https://neurodatawithoutborders.github.io/news), and we are excited to teach our user-base and potential new users about NWB:N and our software tools.
