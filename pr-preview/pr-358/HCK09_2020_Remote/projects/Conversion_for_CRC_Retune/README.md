## Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

In the [working group](https://www.defense-circuits-lab.com/) of Prof. Philip Tovote, we are acquiring a large variety of neurophysiological data and would
like to convert our files into the NWB file format to improve the sharing of our data with the neuroscientific community. Furthermore, we are part of a new 
collaborative research center ([Transregio 295 - RETUNE](https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/424778381?language=en)), which will also acquire large amounts of neurophysiological data. In this CRC, the comparative 
analysis of datasets acquired by different projects within the CRC is a major longterm goal. During this workshop, I would like to explore the NWB file format and its potential
advantages as the common data format for all projects within our CRC. Finally, we are also participating in a german initiative that aims to establish a national
infrastructure for research data for the neurosciences ([NFDI Neuroscience](https://nfdi-neuro.de/index.html)) and are interested in the usability of the NWB
for reasons of this initiative as well.

## Objectives

<!-- Briefly describe the objectives of your project. What would you like to achive?-->

1. Convert files to NWB: I have no experience with the NWB format so far. In a first step, I would like to learn how to convert some of our data into the NWB file format (Ca-imaging movie, movie of behaving animal, timestamps of events)
2. Merge individual NWB files: We record several parameters at the same time and with different software packages (e.g. Plexon and Inscopix). While some data has to be converted into the NWB format, some data can be exported directly in the NWB format. Finally, all data has to be be merged in one NWB file.
3. Working with NWB files for analysis: Once the data was successfully converted into the NWB format, it would be great to get some idea of how NWB files can be processed and analyzed
