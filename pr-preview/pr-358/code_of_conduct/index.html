      <h2 id="code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</h2>

<p>We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free event experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any event venue, including talks. event participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event without a refund at the discretion of the event organizers.</p>

<p>Harassment includes, but is not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion.</li>
  <li>Sexual images in public spaces</li>
  <li>Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following</li>
  <li>Harassing photography or recording</li>
  <li>Sustained disruption of talks or other events</li>
  <li>Inappropriate physical contact</li>
  <li>Unwelcome sexual attention</li>
  <li>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="enforcement">Enforcement</h3>

<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>

<p>Organizers and presenters are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, they should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material.</p>

<p>Event organisers may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for any participants.</p>

<p>If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, event organisers have the responsibility to remind the offender about our Code of Conduct, and warn them that repeated inappropriate, uncivil, threatening, offensive, or harmful behavior can lead to a temporary or permanent ban from the event with no refund. The offending person(s) may also see affected their participation in future NWB and DANDI events.</p>

<p>We expect participants to follow these rules at all event venues and event-related social activities. We think people should follow these rules outside event activities too!</p>

<h3 id="reporting">Reporting</h3>

<p>If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as soon as possible to the events organizers. Harassment and other code of conduct violations reduce the value of our event for everyone. We want you to be happy at our event. People like you make our event a better place.</p>

<p>You can make a report either with your personal email or using an anonymous email.</p>
