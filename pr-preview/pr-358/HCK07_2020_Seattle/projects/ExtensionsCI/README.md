# Improve Support and CI for NWB Extensions

## Key Investigators

- Ryan Ly
- Jean-Christophe Fillion-Robin

## Project Description

- Support user-defined tests in a user extension, and create instructions and a template for setting up CI (with either Azure Pipelines or CircleCI) on the extension (see https://github.com/nwb-extensions/ndx-template/issues/32)
- Support loading of extensions better (see your issue ticket: https://github.com/nwb-extensions/ndx-template/issues/9)
- Set up CI on the https://github.com/nwb-extensions/staged-extensions repo to test that an extension proposed in a PR can be loaded and that all the tests in PyNWB and the user's extension pass
- Set up the same CI on all "record" repositories in the catalog so that when an extension is updated to a new version, the same tests mentioned above are run
