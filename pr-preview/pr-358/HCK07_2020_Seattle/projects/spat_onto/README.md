## Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

Spatial data and metadata are often collected in multiple
reference frames during the same session. Understanding what types of
information users want to extract from different forms of spatial data
should inform the development of ontologies for spatial data/metadata
and reference frames.


## Objectives

<!-- 1. Objective A. Describe it in 1-2 sentences.-->

1. To define a set of user requirements for utilization of the spatial
   data ontology.

2. Identify existing ontologies (for e.g. neuroimaging modalities)
  that we can draw from for representing spatial
  location/extent/registration. 


## Approach and Plan

We plan to consider three use cases:

1. Slice ICEphys
2. Neuropixels ECEphys
3. Brain chunks for transcriptomics
