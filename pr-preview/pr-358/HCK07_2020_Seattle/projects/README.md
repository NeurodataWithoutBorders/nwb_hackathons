## What should my hackathon project look like?

Projects may span a broad range of topics focused around core NWB development, e.g., integrating new data with NWB:N, developing new features for PyNWB, exploring new problems, or creating documentation. Design your project in a way that:
  1. You can make significant progress during the hackathon (i.e., in ~2 days). This also means that you should come prepared for the hackathon (e.g., be ready to read any data you need for your project)
  1. The project is **a)** relevant to NWB:N and **b)** useful either as is or be something that you or someone else can build on after the hackathon

### Does everyone need to have their own project?

Everyone should be part of a project, but not everyone must have their own project. Hacking in teams is fun!

## How to create a new project

When you are ready, create a new project by creating a new `README.md` file in a new subfolder of the [projects](.) folder using the provided [project template][template/] and add your project to the project list in the [PROJECTS.md](PROJECTS.md) file. Step-by-step instructions for creating a new project using GitHub are:

1. Open [project template][template/README.md] and copy its full content to the clipboard
1. Go back to the [projects](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/nwb_hackathons/tree/master/HCK07_2020_Seattle/projects) folder on GitHub
1. Click on "Create new file" button
1. Type `YourProjectName/README.md`
1. Paste the previously copied content of project template page into your new `README.md`
1. Update at least your project's **title**, **key investigators**, and **project description** sections
1. Add a link to your project to the "Assigned Projects" section in the project list of [projects](PROJECTS.md)

Note: some steps above may require creating a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) until your account is given write access.
