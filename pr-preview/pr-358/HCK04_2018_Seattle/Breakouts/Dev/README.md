# Presentation topics

1. How to contribute to PyNWB (step through the process, set up dev env, run tests, submit PR)
2. Continuous Integration in PyNWB

We discussed much of the material that is available in this [blog post series](https://blog.kitware.com/how-to-improve-software-quality-in-open-source-projects-part-i-overview-of-continuous-integration-ci-and-software-process-in-pynwb/), and covered the CI process for PyNWB with a detailed tour.

Future topics for this type of blog post include how to make atomic commits, good commit messages, having a clean history, round trip testing, minor releases, and the contribution process.
