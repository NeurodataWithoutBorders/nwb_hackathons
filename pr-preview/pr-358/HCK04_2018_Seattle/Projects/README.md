# How to create a new project

## First steps:

- Join the weekly [preparation call](../README.md#preparatory-videoconferences) to discuss your idea.
- Post questions about project ideas and teams on the [Hackathon forum][forum].

## Designing your team and project:

To facilitate the discussions around project ideas, you can ask the [Hackathon forum maintainers][maintainers]  to create a sub-team for you.  The subteams that already exist are listed [here][subteams].
- Use the main [Hackathon forum][forum] (or your sub-team forum) to discuss project scope and team membership.
- As you work, distill your ideas into a [pinned discussion][pinned-discussion].  If you use the [project description template][project-description-template], you'll be all set up for the next step (below).
- Ultimately, this space is meant to serve your team, not become a burden, so you should use it however you want.

## Once your project idea is finalized:

- When your project and team members are ready, add a new entry in the list of **Projects** by creating a new `README.md` file in subfolder in `Projects` folder, and copying contents of [project description template][project-description-template] file into it. Step-by-step instructions for this are:

1. Open [project description template][project-description-template] and copy its full content to the clipboard
1. Go back to [Projects](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/nwb_hackathons/tree/master/HCK04_2018_Seattle/Projects) folder on GitHub
1. Click on "Create new file" button
1. Type `YourProjectName/README.md`
1. Paste the previously copied content of project template page into your new `README.md`
1. Update at least your project's **title, key investigators, project description sections**
1. Add a link to your project to the [main project list](../README.md)

Note: some steps above may require creating a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) until your account is given write access.
