\section{Executive Summary}
\label{sec:es}

\paragraph{Overview:} The \href{https://neurodatawithoutborders.github.io}{Neurodata Without Borders: Neurophysiology} (NWB:N) project is an effort to standardize the description and storage of neurophysiology data and metadata. NWB:N enables data sharing and reuse and reduces the energy barrier to applying data analytics both within and across labs. The hackathon consisted of a two-day User Days event and a two-day Developer Days event with a joint social on the second day to facilitate interaction between users and developers. For the User Days, we invited experts from the neuroscience research community to learn about NWB:N and to work on projects toward adoption of NWB:N for their lab's data sharing and analysis needs. For the Developer Days, we invited developers from the neuroinformatics community to integrate NWB:N with data analysis, visualization, storage, and management tools, as well as to discuss and design new features for NWB:N and build and improve core NWB:N infrastructure. 
\vspace{-0.2cm}
\paragraph{Participants:} 43 users and developers from 29 major labs and research institutions attended the event (see page~\pageref{sec:userparticipants}-\pageref{sec:devparticipants}). The background in programming among participants at the User Days varied greatly, ranging from beginners to experts, whereas participants at the developer days generally had a strong background in programming. Most participants had investigated NWB:N prior to the event, but many were in the early stages of exploration and adoption. See also the~\nameref{sec:regsurv} for details.

\vspace{-0.2cm}
\paragraph{User Days:} The~\nameref{sec:program:userdays} consisted of a combination of training sessions in the morning and open hacking sessions in the afternoon. A breakout room for hacking was provided at all times to allow users to select the training programs most relevant to their projects. During the coding sessions, participants worked on their \nameref{sec:userprojects}, which they had designed and prepared prior to the event. The user projects generally focused on integration of neuroscience data with NWB:N and involved data from a broad range of~\nameref{sec:regsurv:datamod}, including: a) electrophysiology (extracellular recordings, intracellular recordings, and electrocorticography), b) optophysiology (2-photon imaging, fluorescent wide-field images, etc.), c) behavioral data, d) processed data (e.g., from spike sorting), e) neural simulations (using NEURON software), and f) stimulus data. The user projects also included data from a number of different model species, such as mice, rats, monkeys, and humans. %See the \nameref{sec:userprojects} section for a more in-depth overview of the user projects at the hackathon.

\vspace{-0.2cm}
\paragraph{Developer Days:} The~\nameref{sec:program:devdays} focused on open hacking sessions and breakout sessions to facilitate interaction between developers and discussion on shared topics of interest and current developments, e.g., best practices, extensions sharing, ontologies, data management, and data visualization. The \nameref{sec:userprojects} during the developer days focused on integration of NWB:N with data analysis, visualization, storage, and management software, and development and enhancement of core NWB:N technologies. 

\vspace{-0.2cm}
\paragraph{Select Highlights:} During the user days, users worked on the integration of data from 14+ different labs and institutions with NWB:N. Importantly, all participants were able to make substantial progress during the hackathon towards integration of their data with NWB:N.

Several early adopters---e.g., the Allen Institute for Brain Science, the FrankLab (UCSF), and Buzsaki Lab (NYU)---have by now made first sets of NWB:N data files available to the public. Several other labs, e.g., the ChangLab (UCSF), have indicated plans for upcoming data releases in NWB:N 2.0. Given that NWB:N 2.0 was released in January 2019 (i.e., only $\approx3.5$ month before the hackathon), this fast move towards data releases is impressive and also very important to promote broad adoption of NWB:N. To enable users to easily find public NWB:N files, we have added an \href{https://neurodatawithoutborders.github.io/exampledata}{Example Data} page to the NWB:N website. 

A highlight here was the presentation by Tom Davidson in which he described time-based queries and visualization at the FrankLab. Incidentally, the Allen Institute had released data 1 week prior to the hackathon in NWB:N 2.0 and so they tried their tools on that data as well. ``Because the data was in the NWB:N standard, we were able to very quickly and directly apply our tools to the Allen Institute's data without requiring interaction with the Allen team'' said Tom, ``This showed us that the promise of data reuse and common analysis tools is not just a distant vision but because of NWB:N is within our reach.''

During the developer days, we were excited to see substantial progress toward integration of NWB:N with important data analysis tools, including, Brainstorm, CaImAn, RAVE, NWBWidgets, and the NWBExplorer as part of Open Source Brain. To enable users to more easily discover tools that support NWB:N, we created an \href{https://neurodatawithoutborders.github.io/tools}{Analysis and Visualization Tools} page as part of the NWB:N website. Developers also explored the integration of Zarr and ExDir as alternative storage backends for NWB:N as well as compatibility between NWB:N and Nix and NWB:N and the DataJoint data pipeline management system. Developers also created tools to facilitate the import of data from common data acquisition devices and systems. Another main focus area was the development of core NWB:N technologies, e.g, for data query, extensions sharing, and documentation. 

\vspace{-0.2cm}
\paragraph{Future Directions:} As part of the hackathon, participants suggested several areas that would greatly enhance the utilization and adoptability of NWB:N:
\begin{itemize}
  \setlength\itemsep{0cm}
  \item \textbf{Extensions sharing:} The ability to share and use extensions across labs was recognized as a critical need. Formalizing and standardizing this process will be critical. This is part of current ongoing efforts towards development of the \href{https://github.com/nwb-extensions}{NWB:N Extension Catalog}.
  \item \textbf{Controlled Vocabularies and Ontologies:} The ability to associate controlled terms  (e.g., enumerations) and complex ontologies with NWB:N data fields was recognized as a central need. This is already on the roadmap for NWB:N development as part of ongoing \href{https://braininitiative.nih.gov/funded-awards/nwbn-data-standard-and-software-ecosystem-neurophysiology}{NIH project} and we used the hackathon to interview participants and gather use-cases for the \href{https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/ontology-project}{NWB:N ontologies project.}
  \item \textbf{Tools for visualization and analysis:} Tools for exploration and visualization of NWB:N was recognized as a general need. This was an active focus of the Developer Days and continues to be a critical thrust area in our outreach activities. 
  \item \textbf{Data search and query:} Advanced tools for search, discovery, and query of NWB:N data are needed to facilitate advanced data analytics. This was also the topic of projects at the Developer Days but we need to expand our efforts in this area as part of future proposals. 
  \item \textbf{Integration with Data Management:} The need for tools to manage large collections of NWB:N files and to facilitate integration of NWB:N with data management tools (e.g., LIMS or DataJoint) was recognized as a common need. While initial efforts in this area are underway, this is a critical area that should be the focus of future proposals. 
  \item \textbf{Documentation, Tutorials, and Standard Import:} While we have made substantial progress over the last 2 years in creating documentation and tutorials, this area requires continued effort and improvement. In particular the need for additional high- and entry-level documentation was recognized and was also the focus of several Developer Days projects. 
\end{itemize}

\vspace{-0.2cm}
\paragraph{Conclusion:}
By the end of the hackathon, the vast majority of attendees had accomplished many of their goals, and several were well on their way to having NWB:N fulfill their labs needs. All attendees indicated an enthusiasm for the current software and were impressed with the (relative) ease of use given the generality. Overall, the hackathon was a great success. See also the \nameref{sec:exitsurv} for further details.

Based on discussions at the hackathon, we plan to have another hackathon in a year for both users and developers. In addition we are also hoping to have a developer-focused hackathon in November to facilitate continued development and close interaction between the developers, to discuss design and strategy, and engage more closely with user projects and use cases.

\subsection{Suggestions for Specific Developments}
\label{sec:es:dev}

In addition to the more high-level direction for future development discussed in the \nameref{sec:es}, we here describe additional, specific developments that were suggested by participants at the hackathon. 

\begin{itemize}
 \setlength\itemsep{0cm}
 \item Easily query within and across NWB:N files for particular data. For example, show me the recorded voltage traces after stimulus X for animals with manipulation Y that were tested between D1 and D2.
 \item Improve the tutorials to cater toward researchers with less programming experience. Users also mentioned that it would be very useful to include more graphics that depict how data is stored and have working boilerplate code where the user just needs to change a few variables to accommodate their data. 
 \item Develop better tutorials to the MatNWB API, and add more convenience functions like in the PyNWB API.
 \item Add ability to define time points within a trial and re-reference timestamps and time series data relative to those time points. For example, users want to easily represent voltage traces aligned to reward time, across trials.
 %\item Add ability to store trialized data, e.g. time series data that has already been segmented by trials, %without having to supply the full time series data, which is not always available.
 \item Add ability to organize raw acquisition data rather than having them all in the same group. This is currently possible for processed data but not acquisition data.
 \item Create a plotting gallery for different neurodata types.
 \item Improve validation of NWB:N files.  
 \item Add ability to dump state of PyNWB/MatNWB during read/write for better debugging.
\end{itemize}

\section{Registration Survey}
\label{sec:regsurv}

As part of the registration we asked all participants about: which 1) software tools and 2) programming languages they are using to interact with their data as well as 3) which data modalities they are using. The questions where posed as multiple-choice questions with the option for users to provide custom other responses. 34 users registered for the User Days, of which 31 attended the User Days. 26 developers registered, of which 25 attended the Developer Days. In total, 45 unique people responded to the survey, i.e., some folks attended and responded to the survey for both the User- and Developer days.

\section{Exit Survey}
\label{sec:exitsurv}

All participants were asked to participate in an exit survey. 15 of the 42 participants (i.e., $~31\%$) submitted responses 
to the survey. 12 of the 15 respondents attended the user days.

\subsection{Hackathon Overall and Testimonials}
\begin{figure*}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/user_developer_exit_survey_hackathon.pdf}
\end{figure*}

\noindent On a scale of 1 (worst) to 5 (best) the average ratings for the hackathon were excellent, which is also reflected in the testimonials the participants provided:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{5} : Experience at HHMI Janelia
    \item \textbf{4.5} : Usefulness of the hackathon overall
    \item \textbf{4.1}: Usefulness of the talks overall
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection*{Testimonials}
As part of the exit survey we asked folks whether they would like to provide any testimonials. The exit survey was anonymous, i.e.,
testimonials are also anonymous unless participants submitted them via email. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item The NWB Hackathon User Days was incredibly useful. Well organized, developers were always present and helpful with answering questions. They created an environment of users and developers coming together to help each other, it was refreshing and so conducive to all the good work that has come out of it!
    \item Coming from zero experience with NWB, the hackathon was very useful to have the developers there to aid with questions the whole time. The whole developer team was so receptive to feedback and quick to make changes to make the users experience better. It was nice to connect with other researchers who are facing similar data management issues and trying to move to NWB. The Janelia research campus was a great venue for the event.
    \item The organizers did an awesome job putting together a hackathon that provided (1) a needed refresher and overview, (2) opportunity to ask questions, and (3) space to work on the datasets in the hacking sessions. Overall close to perfect balance. Thank you!!
    \item Michael Grauer (Kitware):  ``I wanted to say thanks and congrats for putting on a fantastic hackathon. Personally I
really enjoyed it, it was super productive for both me and the Kitware team. I think 
this gave the community a lot of cohesion and momentum, which is a great sign for things 
to come.''
\end{itemize}

\clearpage
\subsection{Software}
\begin{figure*}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/user_developer_exit_survey_software.pdf}
\end{figure*}

\noindent On a scale of 1 (worst) to 5 (best) the average ratings for how hard it was to learn to use the software was \textbf{3.2}. 

\subsection{Talks and Tutorials}

\begin{figure*}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/user_developer_exit_survey_talks.pdf}
\end{figure*}

\noindent Overall the talks were well-received, with average ratings of \textbf{4.2, 4.5, 3.9, 3.9, 4.1,} and \textbf{3.5}, respectively. 

To further improve the ease of on-boarding as folks adopt NWB:N, survey participants suggested the creation of simple, reusable examples. Specific suggestions from the exit survey included:
\begin{itemize}
    \item ``The tutorials provided were very helpful but also have room for improvement (and they have been updated already which is nice). I think it needs to be more clear which aspect of the tutorials are or are not necessary to create a NWB file (i.e. I would start from the most basic bare-bones NWB file and build up from there). I think some generalized examples of how to add in different types of data would go a long way, with detail explaining the intention of each step and why things are stored the way they are. Maybe these exist and I just missed them. It might be too much to ask, but usage examples would be helpful on the docs for each different type (nwb-schema.readthedocs.io).''
    \item ``To simplify people getting started with, especially, their format conversion projects, having a collection of boilerplate codes (that is approved and tested by NWB contributors!) would be super helpful, IMO.''
\end{itemize}

In response to specific user suggestion we have clarified and updated many of the existing online tutorials. We also started a project with the goal to create an \href{https://neurodatawithoutborders.github.io/nwb_hackathons/HCK06_2019_Janelia/projects/Interactive_PyNWB_Course/}{interactive online course for PyNWB}. Improving and expanding documentation and tutorials is an important and perpetual effort. Our goal is to make NWB:N as easy-to-use as possible, and documentation and tutorials are key parts of that.

\section{Hackathon Projects}
\label{sec:userprojects}

Prior to the event, each participant was asked by the organizers to formulate a specific project that 
she/he will work on. The participants created project pages on the \href{https://neurodatawithoutborders.github.io/nwb_hackathons/HCK06_2019_Janelia/#projects}{hackathon GitHub repository}. Participants then updated their pages during (and after) the event to document progress. In the following we provide a brief overview of the various projects. The project headings include links to the specific project pages
for further details. 

\subsection{Data Import/Convert}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \href{https://neurodatawithoutborders.github.io/nwb_hackathons/HCK06_2019_Janelia/projects/BenderOptimization/}{Integrate neuron model optimization and simulation data with NWB:N} The goal of the project is to use NWB:N to store simulated neuron model data, as well as stimuli and parameter sets, instead of the current method of storing data in csv files. The project has made significant progress in identifying native NWB:N data structures to use, determining how best to organize data in NWB:N, learning how to use extensions for the simulation output, and integrating NWB:N with the stimulus generation code.

    \item \href{https://neurodatawithoutborders.github.io/nwb_hackathons/HCK06_2019_Janelia/projects/x_to_nwb/}{Convert data in Abf and Dat formats to NWB:N} The \href{https://github.com/AllenInstitute/ipfx/tree/master/ipfx/x_to_nwb}{x\_to\_nwb} package has been developed to convert two of the most common formats for \textit{in vitro} physiology data -- $.abf$ (pClamp, Molecular Devices) and $.dat$ (PatchMaster, HEKA) -- into the NWB:N format. These tools are new and this project will be focused on investigating their compatibility. The objectives of this project include to 1) determine if there are any lingering issues to be addressed in the latest version of the abf and dat file to nwb converter and to 2) brainstorm strategies for increasing visibility of abf\_and\_dat\_to\_nwb functionality. The project has made significant progress in that: 1) the latest version of the converter works well with several recent example abf and dat files and 2) a list of ways to increase outreach has been started, which includes pulling the converter out of the ipfx package in the Allen SDK and giving it its own repo as well as making sure that the code is clear on the expectations for maintenance.

    \item \href{https://neurodatawithoutborders.github.io/nwb_hackathons/HCK06_2019_Janelia/projects/Interactive_PyNWB_Course/}{Interactive PyNWB Course} Users described a large learning curve for understanding the NWB:N format and using the APIs. The goal of the project is to create a more beginner-friendly, interactive tutorial/mini-course on NWB, starting with PyNWB. Open-source software was used to develop the interactive course, and an existing tutorial was adapted to become Chapter 1. A live demo of the course is linked \href{https://pynwb-course.netlify.com/}{here}.

    \item \href{https://neurodatawithoutborders.github.io/best_practices}{Develop list of best practices} To enable NWB:N to accommodate the needs of the diverse neuroscience community, NWB:N provides a great degree of flexibility. While this flexibility is essential to enable coverage of a broad range of use-cases, it can also lead to ambiguity. Developers and experienced users came together during a Developer Days breakout session to create a \href{https://neurodatawithoutborders.github.io/best_practices}{list of best practices}, which outlines some of the pitfalls to avoid and common usage patterns to emulate.

\section{Code Activity (May 2019)}

The hackathon has helped to create a lot of energy around the NWB:N main repositories. Here we report GitHub 
code statistics for the main NWB:N repositories\footnote{\textbf{Note:} The statistics reported here focus on the main NWB:N repositories only. A majority of hackathon projects involved external data analysis, visualization, storage, and management tools and custom user codes (e.g,. for data conversion) as well as new NWB:N code repositories, e.g., for the 1) \href{https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/pynwb-course}{PyNWB interactive course}, 2) \href{https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/ontology-project}{ontology project}, 3) \href{https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/nwb-jupyter-widgets}{NWB:N jupyter widgets}, and the 4) \href{https://github.com/nwb-extensions}{NWB:N extension catalog},  which are not reflected here.} for the period of 04/30/2019 -- 05/30/2019 (10:30am), with the User Days (May 13-14) and Developer Days (May 15-16) being roughly in the middle of that period.

\subsection{NWB:N Software Repositories}

The charts below summarize activity on the main NWB:N code repositories for 1) \href{https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/pynwb}{PyNWB}, 2) \href{https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/pynwb}{HDMF}, 3) \href{https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/matnwb}{MatNWB}, 4) \href{https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/nwb-schema}{NWB:N Schema}, and the 5) \href{https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/nwb-docutils}{Documentation Utilities}. Across these NWB:N codes we have seen significant progress on features and identification and resolution of issues, with \textbf{61} merged and \textbf{18} proposed pull requests and \textbf{35} closed and \textbf{46} new issues in the 30 day period reported here.
