# NWB Index

## Key Investigators

- Mike Grauer (Kitware)

## Project Description

This project is intended to help with the problem of sharing NWB files, to allow for discoverability, browsing, search, and accessibility. It is a long range project intended to build tools that can index existing NWB files, and to provide guidance to groups wanting to share their data.

The problem this project intends to solve is: How can I decide if some shared NWB files are of interest to me and might solve my research questions?

The broader goals are to foster data reuse and scientific reproducibility.

## Objectives

The objectives of this project require having NWB data available, along with an understanding of what metadata exists to describe and search on the NWB files, and ways of creating static and dynamic visual summaries of those files to assist in discoverability.

Examples of these visualizations are the [ROI thumbnail](https://arclamp.github.io/roi-thumbnail/) and the [OSB NWB Explorer](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/nwb_hackathons/tree/master/HCK06_2019_Janelia/projects/OSB_NWB_Explorer). 

1. Identify NWB files that will be shared in the future
2. Identify metadata and potential visualizations that will help to share NWB files and make the files more discoverable
3. Understand the needs of users interested in sharing their data, and help them make their data more usable
4. Understand the needs of users interested in finding existing data

The primary goal for this hackathon, similar to the [OSB NWB Explorer Project](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/nwb_hackathons/tree/master/HCK06_2019_Janelia/projects/OSB_NWB_Explorer), is to gather examples of NWB datasets and forge collaborations with groups producing and consuming NWB data.

## Approach and Plan

1. Meet with participants to ask about NWB data for sharing and data sharing needs
2. Collect public datasets along with metadata, and ideas about useful visual summaries
3. Discuss with participants current approaches and pain points to sharing data, and find commonalities
4. Understand participants' data release plans, build collaborations to improve usability and discoverability of that data
