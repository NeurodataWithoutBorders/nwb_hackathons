# Lazy cross-file links

## Key Investigators

- Nile Graddis (Allen Institute for Brain Science)

## Project Description

In order to release large files publicly it would be convenient to be able to download components of an NWB file (e.g. LFP data for each of multiple neuropixels probes) ad hoc. Currently cross-file links break on read if the link target is missing.

See [this issue](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/pynwb/issues/907) for more information.

## Objectives

1. Ensure that broken links only raise exceptions on access.
2. Implement lazy access to AIBS lfp data
