## Project Description

Explore possiblilities for integration between the NIX and NWB:N standards and software ecosystems. 

## Objectives

<!-- Briefly describe the objectives of your project. What would you like to achive?-->

<!-- 1. Objective A. Describe it in 1-2 sentences.-->
<!-- 1. Objective B. Describe it in 1-2 sentences.-->
<!-- 1. ...-->

* Explore possible conversion of select types (e.g, for electrophysiology) from NWB:N to NIX
* Explore (for select standard NIX file) conversion of select types to NWB:N types
* Identify possible avenues for future collaboration between NIX and NWB:N

## Approach and Plan

<!-- 1. Describe the steps of your planned approach to reach the objectives.-->
<!-- 1. ... -->
<!-- 1. ... -->

* Select example dataset we can use for testing/evaluation
* Select one or a few NWB:N types (e.g., ElectricalSeries) for conversion to NIX
* Implement conversion of select types (likely in Python from PyNWB container to NIX type)
* Review design of NIX and NWB:N to evaluate feasibility to implement NIX as a backend for NWB:N
