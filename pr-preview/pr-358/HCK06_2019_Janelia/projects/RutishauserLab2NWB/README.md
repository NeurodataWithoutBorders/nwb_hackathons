## Project Description

Convert ephys data (i.e., single unit recordings) and behavior into NWB:N, and develop pipeline to analyze such data in NWB:N 

## Objectives

Briefly describe the objectives of your project. What would you like to achive?

1. Convert native lab data into NWB:N using both matNWB and PyNWB
2. Develop/modify existing pipeline to analyze data in NWB:N
3. Build GUI to easily convert native ephys data into NWB:N (for internal lab users)

## Approach and Plan

1. Continue development of converting data into NWB:N, debug any lingering issues
2. Continue development of modifying analysis scripts to analyze data in NWB, fix lingering issues
