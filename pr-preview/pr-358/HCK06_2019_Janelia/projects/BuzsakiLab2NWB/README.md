Convert Buzsaki lab data formats to NWB.

## Key Investigators

## Project Description

Generate scripts that load data stored in an internal lab data format ("buzcode")
to NWB.

## Objectives

The buzcode lab standard consists of different standards for storing .mat files
depending on the type of data (behavior, LFP, spikes, stim). The goal is to
use the MatNWB interface to create a function that process a recording session
and load its contents into NWB.

Objective A. Load the spiking data
Objective B. Load the LFP data
Objective C. Load the stimulus data

## Approach and Plan

Generate a MATLAB function that takes variable inputs specifying which parts
of a recording session are to be converted and saved as NWB files. The plan
is to provideuser's who want to use the data with flexibility as to which
parts of the data (spikes, stimulus times, etc.) are to be loaded.
