To attend the meeting remotely, please complete the [remote attendee registration form](https://goo.gl/forms/che8NIHzngXLwVIs1).  Remote attendance is for the the talks and tutorials only. Local attendance is required in order to actively participate in hacking and project sessions.

## Logistics

**Housing:** Housing will be onsite on the Janelia research campus. For details about transportation and logistics please see [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/i2540enmapap05o/Janelia%20travel%20logistics.pdf?dl=0)

**Travel:** Travel support is being provided by the Kavli foundation. As housing will be onsite on the Janelia research campus, travel support is intended for flights (not housing). Funds available to support attendee travel are limited! Travel arrangements must be pre-approved by the Foundation’s Executive Assistant. If you use the Kavli travel services (recommended) then please CC Stephanie Albin (salbin@kavlifoundation.org) to get approval for the travel cost. Also, if you are planing to book your own flights then please make sure to get PRE-APPROVAL from Stephanie Albin (salbin at kavlifoundation.org). Please see the [Kavli reimbursement guidelines](travel/Kavli_Reimbursement_Guidelines.pdf) for details. The traveler profile form is available [here](travel/CT_Traveler_Profile.docx).

**Directions:** The Janelia Research Campus is located in Loudoun County, Virginia – just 30 miles from Washington, DC, and about eight miles north of Dulles International Airport (IAD). For directions see [https://www.janelia.org/directions](https://www.janelia.org/directions)

## What to bring?

* Create the outline for your project at the hackathon. For further details and instructions on how to create a project see [here](projects/README.md)
* Bring any example data sets needed for your project with you to the hackathon. For any lab-specific data (i.e., data not in NWB:N) you should know how to read the data using Python and ideally have scripts ready for reading the data.
* Bring your laptop with appropriate software installed. For instructions on how to install PyNWB see [http://pynwb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#installation](http://pynwb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#installation)

## Objective

The Neurodata Without Borders: Neurophysiology project (NWB:N, https://neurodatawithoutborders.github.io/) is an effort to standardize the description and storage of neurophysiology data and metadata. NWB:N enables data sharing and reuse and reduces the energy-barrier to applying data analytics both within and across labs. Several laboratories, including the Allen Institute for Brain Science, have wholeheartedly adopted NWB:N. The community needs to join forces to achieve data standardization in neurophysiology.

The purpose of the hackathon is to bring the experimental neurophysiology community together to further adoption and the development of NWB:N, the NWB:N software libraries, and the progress of the scientific workflows that rely on NWB:N. Members of the community will exchange ideas and best practices for using NWB:N and the libraries, share NWB:N based tools, surface common needs, solve bugs, make feature requests, brainstorm about future funding and collaboration, and make progress on current blockages. The event will also enable NWB:N developers and users to interact with each other to facilitate communication, gather requirements, and train users.

The event is planned for 4 days, where the first two days will focus on user training and use-cases followed by two days focused on core development. Work involves collaborative, open source software development, with a focus on use cases, tools, and core development.

Note: This event is meant to foster community and collaboration around NWB:N, not competition. As such, this is really more of a "workshop" or "tutorial" than a "hackathon." There will be no judges nor prizes. Participants will be expected to bring data from their own lab and/or collaborate with others to build integration with NWB:N.
