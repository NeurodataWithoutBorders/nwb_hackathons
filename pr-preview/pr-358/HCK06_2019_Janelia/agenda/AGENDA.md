We are planing to have this be a full-day event for May 13 - 16, 2019 consisting of 2 days for user training and engagement (May 13-14) followed by 2 days for developer hackathon (May 15-16). On May 14 (late afternoon) we will have a joint user & developer social. The event will begin early in the morning on May 13, i.e., if you are attending the user days, please plan to arrive on May 12 and depart in the evening on May 14 after the social. If you are attending the developer days, then plan to arrive in the afternoon on May 14 to attend the social and plan to depart in the evening on May 16 after completion of the event. Below the current draft of the agenda. **The agenda is work in progress! Further details will be announced here as they become available** [Download Agenda](agenda/agenda_nwb_hackathon_2019.pdf)
