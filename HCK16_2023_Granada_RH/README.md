## Report

The final report for NeuroDataReHack 2023 is now available online at  [[PDF (GitHub)](report/Report__NeuroDataReHack_2023.pdf)] [[LaTeX (Overleaf)](https://www.overleaf.com/read/gzpkpyzcrvfr#1400b0)].

## Dates and Location

- **Dates:** September 5-8, 2023
- **Location:** [Hotel Andalucia Center in Granada, Spain](https://www.hotelescenter.es/en/hotel-andalucia-center-granada/)
  ([google maps](https://goo.gl/maps/rufpp3g39Aefnj289))

## Objective
[The DANDI Archive](http://dandiarchive.org) now has 110+ neurophysiology datasets in the 
[Neurodata Without Borders](http://nwb.org) format  spanning many species, brain  areas, task types, and imaging 
modalities. These include high-value datasets, e.g. from The Allen Institute, the MICrONS project, and the 
International Brain Laboratory, as well as diverse contributions from neuroscience labs around the world. In this 
workshop, we will teach attendees about the open neurophysiology datasets available on the DANDI Archive and train 
them on how to maximally utilize the archive and the NWB standard to incorporate existing data into their scientific 
workflows. Feedback from attendees will be used to improve the software and data standard to better enable 
reanalysis workflows.

Prior to the workshop, we are organizing [Open Neurodata Showcase](../HCK16_2023_OpenNeuroDataShowcase/README.md) where attendees can meet the contributors
behind the neurophysiology datasets and explore virtual posters. Visit the [event page](../HCK16_2023_OpenNeuroDataShowcase/README.md#application) to sign up
and read more about this feature event.

Example projects include but are not limited to:
* Determine whether your result is present in another species or brain area.
* Showcase the capabilities of your tool or analysis on existing data from another lab.
* Explore follow-up questions to a study.

Following the event, participants will be invited to apply for a Kavli Foundation Neurodata Discovery Award, which 
awards $50,000 (USD) of funding to continue data reanalysis projects that come out of the NeuroDataReHack event. Details about the Kavli Foundation Neurodata Discovery Award will be provided closer to the event. 

This event is held as a satellite of the [IBRO World Congress 2023](http://ibro2023.org) with the goal of making 
it more accessible to diverse participants who might not otherwise have the opportunity to participate in this
workshop. Attendance of IBRO 2023 is not a requirement for application.

This event will primarily focus on analyzing existing data in NWB and on DANDI, **not** converting data to NWB. If 
you are interested in learning how to convert data, consider signing up for an NWB User Days event.

## Eligibility

This course is intended for PhD students, postdoctoral researchers, principal investigators, or similar.
Applicants should have basic programming experience in Python or MATLAB and experience with neurophysiology research.


## Application

**Applications are now closed.** 

Space for the event is limited. Apply to attend NeuroDataReHack 2023 [here](https://forms.gle/akaThWFBJrv7udev9). 

* Application deadline: May 8
* Notification of admission decisions: June 1

## Logistics

Thanks to the generous sponsorship of The Kavli Foundation, this event will be free to participants:
* There is no registration or application fee.
* Participants will be provided a private room at the Hotel Andalucia Center Hotel for the duration of this event, 
  checking in on Monday, September 4 and checking out on Saturday, September 9th, the day that the IBRO conference 
  starts. **Note that we previously stated that check out would be on Friday, September 8th.**
* Breakfast, lunch, dinner, and coffee breaks will be provided.
* You will be responsible for booking your own flight to the event. If you need financial assistance for travel, 
  consider applying for an [IBRO travel grant](https://ibro.org/world-congress-travel-grants/), which can be used to
  arrive early for this event. The deadline for travel grant applications is March 28.
* You will be responsible for determining visa and/or healthcare requirements for travel to Spain.

## Organizing Committee

**Program chairs:**
* Benjamin Dichter, CatalystNeuro
* Oliver Rübel, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
