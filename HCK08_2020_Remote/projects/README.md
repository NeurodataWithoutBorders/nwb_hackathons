## What should my hackathon project look like?

Projects may span a broad range of topics, e.g., converting data to NWB, developing new features for PyNWB/MatNWB, exploring new problems, or creating documentation. Design your project in a way that:
  1. You can make significant progress during the hackathon (i.e., in ~1-2 days). This also means that you should come prepared for the hackathon. For example, if your project is about converting data to NWB then you should know the data and ideally have scripts for reading the data in Python or MATLAB already working and prepared.
  1. The project is relevant to NWB and useful either as is or would be something that you or someone else can build on after the hackathon

### Does everyone need to have their own project?

Everyone should be part of a project, but not everyone must have their own project. Hacking in teams is fun!

## How to create a new project

When you are ready, create a new project by creating a new `README.md` file in a new subfolder of the [projects](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/nwb_hackathons/tree/master/HCK08_2020_Remote/projects) folder using the provided [project description template][project-description-template] and add your project to the project list in the [PROJECTS.md](PROJECTS.md) file. Step-by-step instructions for creating a new project using GitHub are:

1. Open [project description template][project-description-template] and copy its full content to the clipboard
1. Go to the [projects](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/nwb_hackathons/tree/master/HCK08_2020_Remote/projects) folder on GitHub
1. Click the "Create new file" button (toward the top-right of the page)
1. Type `YourProjectName/README.md` as the new file name. Your project name should not have any spaces. 
1. Paste the previously copied content from the project template page into your new `README.md`
1. Update at least your project's **title**, **key investigators**, and **project description** sections
1. Click the "Propose new file" button
1. Click the "Create pull request" button to open a pull request
1. Click the "Create pull request" button. After an administrator reviews and merges your pull request, the workshop website will be updated.
1. Add a link to your project to the "Assigned Projects" section in the [project list](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/nwb_hackathons/blob/master/HCK08_2020_Remote/projects/PROJECTS.md) by editing the page. You will have to follow similar steps as above to create a pull request to have your changes merged.
