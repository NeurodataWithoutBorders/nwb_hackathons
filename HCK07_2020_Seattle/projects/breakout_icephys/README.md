# Intracellular Ephys (Extension Proposal and Beyond)

**Session Chair:** Oliver Ruebel (LBNL)

In this session we will review the proposed extension for ICEphys as well as discuss more broadly needs and requirements
to enhance storage and sharing of icephys data via NWB.

## Participants

* Oliver Ruebel (LBNL)
* Ryan Ly (LBNL)

## Objectives

* Identify challenges and needs in storing and sharing ICEphys data using NWB
* Evalute suitability of the proposed extension for ICEphys for various use cases
* Refine the extension proposal

## Approach and Plan

Presented the current state of the extension. 

## Progress and Next Steps

We identified several areas for changes to the extension and identified a timeline for release of the extension as part of NWB. For details see the [icephs-extension project page](../icephys_extension)
