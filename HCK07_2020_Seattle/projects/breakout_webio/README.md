# NWB via the web: Linking data and accessing NWB files via the web

**Session Chair:** Andrew Tritt (LBNL)

The goal of this session is to discuss needs and approaches for linking data via NWB and access of parts of NWB files via the network.

## Participants

* Andrew Tritt (LBNL)
* Oliver Ruebel (LBNL)
* Yaroslav Halchenko (Dartmouth College)
* Lydia Ng (Allen Insititute for Brain Science)
* Michael Grauer (Kitware, Inc.)
* Satrajit Ghosh (MIT)
* ...

## Objectives

* Identify use-cases and requirements for accessing parts of NWB files via the network (Local, LAN, and WAN)
* Identify possible approaches for enabling linking of data via NWB

### Proposed discussion topics

Participants should add topics of possible interest for discussion here

* How can we support foreign fields in NWB (i.e., support linking to data from NWB)?
* How can we enable web-based access to NWB files?
* Do we need alternative storage backends to facilitate web-based data access (e.g., HDF5, KITA, ZARR, ...)?
*
