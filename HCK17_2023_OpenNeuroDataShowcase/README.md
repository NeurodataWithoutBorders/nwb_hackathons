## Report

The combined report for NeuroDataReHack 2023 and the Open Neurodata Showcase 2023 is now available online at [[PDF (GitHub)](../HCK16_2023_Granada_RH/report/Report__NeuroDataReHack_2023.pdf)] [[LaTeX (Overleaf)](https://www.overleaf.com/read/gzpkpyzcrvfr#1400b0)].

## Dates and Location

- **Dates:** August 28, 9 - 10:30AM PDT (UTC-7) 2023
- **Location:** Virtual in Gather (link to be shared closer to the event date)

## Objective
[The DANDI Archive](http://dandiarchive.org) now has 175+ neurophysiology datasets in the 
[Neurodata Without Borders](http://nwb.org) format spanning many species, brain areas, task types, and imaging 
modalities. These include high-value datasets, e.g., from The Allen Institute, the MICrONS project, and the 
International Brain Laboratory, as well as diverse contributions from neuroscience labs around the world.
In this event, we organize a virtual poster session in the Gather platform to bring together data contributors
and anyone interested in reusing existing neurophysiology data.
This virtual event offers a unique opportunity for participants to engage in discussions, explore dandisets, 
and allows data contributors to showcase their projects.

## Eligibility

This virtual event is open to anyone interested in neurophysiology data, including but not limited to:
* Neuroscience graduate students, post-docs, and other researchers interested in using open data in their research
* Educators who want to use real datasets in their lessons
* Undergraduates and high school students interested in learning about neuroscience
* Open science advocates

## Application

If you are interested in **attending** the event, register [here](https://forms.gle/dh8eArbw836TpLyq8). 

If you are interested in **presenting** your dandiset(s), register as a presenter at Open Neurodata Showcase 2023 [here](https://forms.gle/neGrkBaWsJvDoVd18).
