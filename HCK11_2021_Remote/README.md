## Dates and Location

- **Dates:** August 25-27, 2021
- **Location:** Anywhere with an internet connection

## Overview

The workshop will focus primarily on user training, including lessons for 
complete beginners to NWB and training in more advanced usage of NWB. 
There will be breakout sessions where the developers of state-of-the-art 
data analysis, visualization, and management tools (e.g., CaImAn, 
SpikeInterface, DANDI, suite2p, DataJoint, and more) will demonstrate 
their tools and show how to use NWB with their tools. There will also 
be time for attendees to work on NWB-related projects, such as converting
data to NWB, using NWB-compatible software tools, or going through the 
NWB online tutorials. See the [INCF event page](https://www.incf.org/neurodata-without-borders-nwb-user-training-workshop) for more details.
