## Dates and Location

- **Dates:** August 25-27, 2021
- **Location:** Anywhere with an internet connection

## Overview

The workshop will focus primarily on user training, including lessons for 
complete beginners to NWB and training in more advanced usage of NWB. 
There will be breakout sessions where the developers of state-of-the-art 
data analysis, visualization, and management tools (e.g., CaImAn, 
SpikeInterface, DANDI, suite2p, DataJoint, and more) will demonstrate 
their tools and show how to use NWB with their tools. There will also 
be time for attendees to work on NWB-related projects, such as converting
data to NWB, using NWB-compatible software tools, or going through the 
NWB online tutorials. See the [INCF event page](https://www.incf.org/neurodata-without-borders-nwb-user-training-workshop) for more details.

## Logistics

We will be using the Zoom videoconferencing platform for the meeting.
We will send an email in the days before the workshop with Zoom links.

It is possible to use Zoom from the browser, but we recommend you install the Zoom app on your computer or phone.
See installation instructions [here](https://zoom.us/download).

## Organizing Committee

**Program chairs:** Benjamin Dichter, Ryan Ly, Andrew Tritt, Pam Baker, and Oliver Ruebel

Additional organizational support is provided by the Kavli Foundation.

## Resources

Recorded talks will be uploaded after the talks are given.

## How to prepare?

Install the Python or MATLAB software for NWB:
  * PyNWB (Python): [https://pynwb.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started.html](https://pynwb.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started.html)
  * MatNWB (MATLAB): [https://neurodatawithoutborders.github.io/matnwb/#setup](https://neurodatawithoutborders.github.io/matnwb/#setup)

## Projects

During the workshop, there will be time to work on NWB-related projects to practice using the NWB software and ask
questions to the NWB developers. Working on a project is optional but encouraged for you to get the most out of this
workshop.

Here are suggestions for projects:
  * convert some of your or a collaborator's data to NWB
  * convert data from a public archive to NWB
  * integrate a software tool with NWB
  * work through NWB online tutorials
  * practice using NWB-compatible tools on publicly available NWB data, e.g., on [DANDI](https://dandiarchive.org/)

Please create a project page with a description of the goals of your project.
See the instructions [here](projects/README.md) to create a project page.
We will use these pages to connect people who are working on similar projects (e.g. converting data from the same acquisition system) and follow your progress.

## Objective

The Neurodata Without Borders project (NWB, [https://www.nwb.org/](https://www.nwb.org/)) is an effort to 
standardize the description and storage of neurophysiology data and metadata.
NWB enables data sharing and reuse and reduces the energy barrier to applying data analysis both within and across labs.
Several laboratories, including the Allen Institute for Brain Science, have wholeheartedly adopted NWB.
The community needs to join forces to achieve data standardization in neurophysiology.

The purpose of the NWB User Days training workshops is to bring the experimental neurophysiology community together to
further the adoption and development of NWB, the NWB software libraries, and scientific workflows that rely on NWB.
Members of the community will exchange ideas and best practices for using NWB, share NWB-based tools, surface common needs, resolve coding issues, make feature requests, brainstorm about future collaboration, and make progress on current blockages.
The event will also enable NWB developers and users to interact with each other to facilitate communication, gather requirements, and train users.
