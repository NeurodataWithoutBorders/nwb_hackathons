# Convert simulated primary motor cortex data to NWB format

## Key Investigators

 - Donald Doherty (SUNY Downstate Medical Center)
 - Salvador Dura-Bernal (SUNY Downstate Medical Center)
 - William Lytton (SUNY Downstate Medical Center)

## Project Description

Convert a dataset from our large scale model of mouse primary motor cortex into NWB format. The dataset will include submillisecond spike trains from 10,073 neurons, each identified and from one of 15 neuron subtypes from across 6 layers. In addition, we hope to include connectivity data (approximately 20 million connections).
