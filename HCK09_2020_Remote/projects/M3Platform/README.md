# One-Photon Calcium Imaging of Neuronal Dysnamics During Behaviour

## Key Investigators

- Kenneth S. Dyson (Douglas Hospital Research Centre)
- Mark P. Brandon (McGill University)--

## Project Description

The McGill-Mouse-Miniscope (M3) platform combines miniscope calcium imaging recording in mice with standardized touchscreen-based behavioral testing. The goal is to curate an open-source and standardized framework for acquiring, analyzing, and
accessing high-quality data of the neuronal dynamics that underly cognition throughout the brain in mice, marmosets, and models of disease.

## Objectives

I would like to convert our data structure (Raw calcium and behaviour video, behaviour event time stamps, extracted calcium intensisty and temporal data) to NWB format for sharing with the neuroscience community.
