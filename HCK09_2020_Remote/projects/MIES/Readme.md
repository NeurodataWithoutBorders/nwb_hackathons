# MIES

## Key Investigators

- Thomas Braun (byte physics e.K.)
- Tim Jarsky (Allen Institute for Brain Science)

## Project Description

We will present MIES, a proven sweep based data acquisition
software package for intracellular electrophysiology (patch clamp). It uses NWB for experimental data and metadata storage,
stimulus set storing and allows to load it back in from NWB.
