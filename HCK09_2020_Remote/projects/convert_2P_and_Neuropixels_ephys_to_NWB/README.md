## Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

The data are associated with the publication [Arousal modulates retinal output](https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(20)30318-4) 
and are publicly available [here](https://doi.org/10.5522/04/c.4934931). 
The data consist of several datasets comprising two-photon imaging data of retinal axon terminals and neurons in the superior colliculus (SC), 
Neuropixels recording from the optic tract and neurons in SC (with simultaneous optogenetic inactiavtion of primary visual cortex), 
behavioural data, data of visual stimuli, and preprocessed data (e.g. parameters of fitted tuning curves).
