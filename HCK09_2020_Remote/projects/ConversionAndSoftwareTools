## Project Description

For my PhD UI study the network organisation of both human and mice dentate gyrus. I analysed calcium imaging with clustering methods and I simulate mice dentategyrus with NEURON software.
The analysis of calcium imaging is a non trivial problem and I want to better understand CaIman and add machine learning methods to the software. Then be abmle to better share it.
The simutaion work is just a begenning for the moment but I want to be able to share it and to improve the simulation tools 

## Objectives

<!-- Briefly describe the objectives of your project. What would you like to achive?-->

1) Learn to work with NWB datas and tools because I am new on the platform. And have a lesson on how convert data to NWB standards.
2) Improve my experience on NWB software as CaIman
3) Experiment how NWB could help me to improve my researches and to better share results.

## Approach and Plan

<!-- 1. Describe the steps of your planned approach to reach the objectives.-->
