## Dates and Location

- **Dates:** July 2, 9 - 10:30AM PDT (UTC-7) 2024
- **Location:** Virtual in Gather (link to be shared closer to the event date)

## Objective
[The DANDI Archive](http://dandiarchive.org) now has 199+ neurophysiology datasets in the 
[Neurodata Without Borders](http://nwb.org) format  spanning many species, brain  areas, task types, and imaging 
modalities. These include high-value datasets, e.g. from [Allen Institute OpenScope](https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/search?search=openscope), the [MICrONS project](https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/000402), and the 
[International Brain Laboratory Brain Wide Map](https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/000409), as well as diverse contributions from neuroscience labs around the world.

In this event, we organize a virtual poster session in the Gather platform to bring together data contributors
and anyone interested in reusing existing neurophysiology data.
This virtual event offers a unique opportunity for participants to engage in discussions, explore dandisets, 
and allows data contributors to showcase their projects.

## Eligibility

This virtual event is open to anyone interested in neurophysiology data, including but not limited to:
* Neuroscience graduate students, post-docs, and other researchers interested in using open data in their research
* Educators who want to use real datasets in their lessons
* Undergraduates and high school students interested in learning about neuroscience
* Open science advocates

## Application

If you are interested in **attending** the event, register [here](https://forms.gle/amPd4h5kN9BPLX4g7). 

If you are interested in **presenting** your dandiset(s), register as a presenter at Open Neurodata Showcase 2024 [here](https://forms.gle/FwMEEtvQUtzFiEhg7).
