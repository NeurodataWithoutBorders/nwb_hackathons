# Welcome to the NWB & DANDI Tutorial at COSYNE 2024!

The [Neurodata Without Borders (NWB)](https://www.nwb.org/) team is holding a tutorial on the NWB data standard and [DANDI Archive](https://www.dandiarchive.org/)during the tutorial session of COSYNE 2024.

The NWB project is an effort to standardize the description and storage of neurophysiology data and metadata. NWB enables data sharing and reuse and reduces the energy barrier to analyzing data both within and across labs. NWB is more than just a file format; it defines an [ecosystem](https://nwb-overview.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tools/tools_home.html) of tools, methods, and standards for storing, sharing, and analyzing complex neurophysiology data, including extracellular electrophysiology, intracellular electrophysiology, optical physiology, and behavior.

The DANDI Archive now has 175+ publicly available neurophysiology datasets stored using the NWB data standard.

At this tutorial, we will teach you how to:

- convert neurophysiology data to NWB and publish it on the DANDI Archive

- find relevant data on the DANDI Archive and use the DANDI compute resources

- read NWB data streamed from DANDI or downloaded locally

- process and analyze NWB data using popular tools such as SpikeInterface and Pynapple

Bring your laptop to work along with the demonstration. To get familiar with NWB and DANDI prior to attending, please refer to this [documentation](https://nwb-overview.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).



## Registration

There is NO additional fee to attend. When registering for the main meeting, select the "Neurodata Without Borders Data Standard and DANDI Archive for Neurophysiology Data Tutorial".



## Dates and Location

* **Date/Time:** February 29, 2024, 9 - 11 AM
* **Location:** TBD, Lisbon Conference Center, Lisbon, Portugal



## Tutorial Program (tentative)

9:00 - 9:30: Lecture: Introduction to the NWB data standard and DANDI Archive

9:30 - 9:55: Follow along: How to convert common neurophysiology data to NWB, read NWB files, and publish NWB data to DANDI

9:55 - 10:00: Q&A, break

10:00 - 10:15: Lecture: Using the DANDI Archive and DANDI API to find relevant data

10:15 - 10:30: Follow along: How to use the DANDI Hub to find and explore NWB files on DANDI

10:30 - 10:55: Follow along: How to analyze NWB data using popular data processing and visualization tools, such as:

- [SpikeInterface](https://github.com/SpikeInterface/spikeinterface#spikeinterface-a-unified-framework-for-spike-sorting) to sort raw extracellular electrophysiology recording data streamed from DANDI & write the output back to NWB

- [Pynapple](https://pynapple-org.github.io/pynapple/) to perform common analysis functions on NWB data, such as tuning curves and cross-correlograms.
