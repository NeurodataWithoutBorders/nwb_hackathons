<!-- ## Report -->

<!-- The final report for the 2025 NWB Community Hackathon is now available on GitHub ([PDF](report/Report_18th_NWB_Developer_Hackathon.pdf)) ([LaTeX (on Overleaf)](https://www.overleaf.com/read/zcdnqtcmwgpv#d964cb)). -->

## Overview

The Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) team is organizing a community hackathon to bring together scientists, research 
software engineers, and students who want to become involved with NWB development, tool integration, outreach, 
and/or training by hacking on projects together. This hackathon will enable participants to work intensively on 
NWB-related projects with the assistance of the NWB development team and others in the community. In addition, we
will hold discussions on how best to solve technical and social problems that impact the broader community. The ultimate
goals of the event are to foster collaboration and build community support around NWB data standardization.

This is the first NWB hackathon event hosted by the Flatiron Institute, which is home to active projects in the 
NWB software ecosystem, such as Pynapple, NeMoS, Neurosift, and CaImAn. Hackathon projects can be on any topic, but we
encourage projects that relate to NWB integration with these tools.

Please note: This community hackathon is *not* a training event. There will be no introductory-level talks or lessons
that teach attendees on how to use NWB. However, if you are new to NWB, you are still welcome to attend the hackathon.
The NWB team provides many 
[video tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZiSesEVA3o&list=PL5wPNhoBP0ZB2sLuRKWqwgXf9V3FRl1bw) and 
[online documentation](https://nwb-overview.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro_to_nwb/1_intro_to_nwb.html) that you can
learn from before or during the hackathon. If you want to learn how to convert your data to NWB, we encourage
you to attend the 
[virtual NWB Data Conversion Workshop](https://neurodatawithoutborders.github.io/nwb_hackathons/HCK22_2025_DataConversion_Remote/)
in May 2025.

## Organizing Committee

**Site Chair:** TBD

**Program chairs:** [Ryan Ly](https://crd.lbl.gov/divisions/scidata/mla/staff/ryan-ly/) and 
[Matthew Avalyon](https://crd.lbl.gov/divisions/scidata/mla/staff/matthew-avaylon/)


## Objective

The [Neurodata Without Borders](https://www.nwb.org/) project is an effort to standardize the description and storage of neurophysiology data and metadata. NWB enables data sharing and reuse and reduces the energy barrier to applying data analytics both within and across labs. NWB has seen wide adoption in the neurophysiology community, and there are now over 300 datasets on the DANDI Archive in NWB, including data from the Allen Institute and the International Brain Laboratory.

The NWB Community Hackathon will bring neuroscientists, tool builders, and research software engineers together to further the development of the NWB software ecosystem, including the data standard, core software packages, official tools, and community tools. Members of the community will exchange ideas and best practices for using NWB and the libraries, share NWB-based tools, surface common needs, solve bugs, make feature requests, brainstorm about future funding and collaboration, and make progress on current blockages.

**Note:** This event is meant to foster community and collaboration around NWB, not competition. There will be no judges or prizes. Participants are expected to bring their own software tool or data, other relevant project, and/or collaborate with others to build integration with NWB.
