## What should my hackathon project look like?

Projects may span a broad range of topics focused around core NWB development, e.g., integrating new data with NWB, developing new features for PyNWB, exploring new problems, or creating documentation. Design your project in a way that:
  1. You can make significant progress during the hackathon (i.e., in ~2 days). This also means that you should come prepared for the hackathon (e.g., be ready to read any data you need for your project)
  1. The project is **a)** relevant to NWB and **b)** useful either as is or be something that you or someone else can build on after the hackathon

### Does everyone need to have their own project?

Everyone should be part of a project, but not everyone must have their own project. Hacking in teams is fun!

## How to create a new project


To ease collaborative editing of projects we are managing projects in the following [GoogleDoc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQnXlTmqSpKagTF9ObzZKFPw5rWbQzJVlyZlayH-xJ_To-LrYN-IuVjGeEWfW9cd_DY3GQq5uXcExRj/pub). To create a new project, simply:

1. Open the [Project GoogleDoc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQnXlTmqSpKagTF9ObzZKFPw5rWbQzJVlyZlayH-xJ_To-LrYN-IuVjGeEWfW9cd_DY3GQq5uXcExRj/pub). If you are participating and do not have edit access, then please contact the hackahton organizers via email or Slack to request access. 
1. Make a copy of the project template section and add it to the end of the document
1. Update at least your project's **title**, **key investigators**, and **project description** sections

### Using GitHub pages

During previous hackathon events we had used GitHub pages to manage projects. We generally encourage teams to use the [Project GoogleDoc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQnXlTmqSpKagTF9ObzZKFPw5rWbQzJVlyZlayH-xJ_To-LrYN-IuVjGeEWfW9cd_DY3GQq5uXcExRj/pub) instead. However, if your team prefers to use GitHub pages to manage your project instead, then please follow the instructions below.

To create a new project page on GitHub, please create a new `README.md` file in a new subfolder of the [projects](.) folder using the provided [project template][template/] and add your project to the [Project GoogleDoc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQnXlTmqSpKagTF9ObzZKFPw5rWbQzJVlyZlayH-xJ_To-LrYN-IuVjGeEWfW9cd_DY3GQq5uXcExRj/pub). Step-by-step instructions for creating a new project using GitHub are:

1. Open [project template][template/README.md] and copy its full content to the clipboard
1. Go back to the [projects](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/nwb_hackathons/tree/master/HCK10_2021_Remote/projects) folder on GitHub
1. Click on "Create new file" button
1. Type `YourProjectName/README.md`
1. Paste the previously copied content of project template page into your new `README.md`
1. Update at least your project's **title**, **key investigators**, and **project description** sections
1. Add a section with the title of your project to the  [Project GoogleDoc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQnXlTmqSpKagTF9ObzZKFPw5rWbQzJVlyZlayH-xJ_To-LrYN-IuVjGeEWfW9cd_DY3GQq5uXcExRj/pub) and include a link to your project page so that other teams can easily find your project.

Note: some steps above may require creating a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) until your account is given write access.
