## Key Investigators

- [Garrett Flynn](https://github.com/garrettmflynn) ([Brains@Play](https://github.com/brainsatplay), USC)

## Project Description

Create a JavaScript API for creating and interacting with NWB files directly on the browser.

## Objectives

1. Objective A. Mirror the Python API to allow for reading / writing NWB files.
2. Objective B. Integrate with the [Data Capture and Streams API](https://github.com/brainsatplay/datastreams-api) to organize real-time EEG and fNIRS data streams acquired through the browser.
3. Objective C. Create an experiment using [brainsatplay.js](https://github.com/brainsatplay/brainsatplay) that saves data in the NWB format and represents results across individual sessions and (through an opt-in process) across the community of users.

## Approach and Plan

> Note: To discuss in further detail with core NWB developers.

1. Convert the Python API
2. Use the Muse 2 headband and the HEGduino to run data streams into an NWB file.
3. Integrate new code into the Brains@Play experiment template (Eyes Open / Closed Alpha Power).
