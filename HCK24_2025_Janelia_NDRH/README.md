## Dates and Location

- **Dates:** July 14-18, 2025
- **Location:** [HHMI Janelia Research Campus](https://www.janelia.org/), 19700 Helix Dr, Ashburn, VA 20147,
  [Openstreetmap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=39.0708&mlon=-77.4655#map=14/39.0708/-77.4655)
  [Directions](https://www.janelia.org/directions)

## Objective
[The DANDI Archive](http://dandiarchive.org) now has 300+ neurophysiology datasets in the 
[Neurodata Without Borders](http://nwb.org) format  spanning many species, brain  areas, task types, and imaging 
modalities. These include high-value datasets, e.g. from [Allen Institute OpenScope](https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/search?search=openscope), the [MICrONS project](https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/000402), and the 
[International Brain Laboratory Brain Wide Map](https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/000409), as well as diverse contributions from neuroscience labs around the world. In this 
workshop, we will teach attendees about the open neurophysiology datasets available on the DANDI Archive and train 
them on how to maximally utilize the archive and the NWB standard to incorporate existing data into their scientific 
workflows. Feedback from attendees will be used to improve the software and data standard to better enable 
reanalysis workflows.


Prior to the workshop, we are organizing [Open Neurodata Showcase](../HCK23_2025_OpenNeurodataShowcase/README.md) where
attendees can meet the contributors behind the neurophysiology datasets and explore virtual posters. Visit the
[event page](../HCK23_2025_OpenNeurodataShowcase/README.md#application) to sign up and read more about this feature
event.


Example projects include but are not limited to:
* Determine whether your result is present in another species or brain area.
* Showcase the capabilities of your tool or analysis on existing data from another lab.
* Explore follow-up questions to a study.
* Create educational content that uses open data.

<!-- 
Following the event, participants will be invited to apply for a Kavli Foundation Neurodata Discovery Award, which 
awards $50,000 (USD) of funding to continue data reanalysis projects that come out of the NeuroDataReHack event. Details about the Kavli Foundation Neurodata Discovery Award will be provided closer to the event.
-->
This event will primarily focus on analyzing existing data in NWB and on DANDI, **not** converting data to NWB. If 
you are interested in learning how to convert data, consider signing up for an NWB Data Conversion Workshop.

## Eligibility

This course is intended for PhD students, postdoctoral researchers, principal investigators, or similar.
Applicants should have basic programming experience in Python or MATLAB and experience with neurophysiology research.

## Testimonials from NeuroDataReHack 2024

This workshop was enlightening, and I'm excited to bring these tools back to my research group and my university!
- Miles Martinez, Duke University

----------

The Hackathon was an incredible experience. I had the opportunity to get familiar with not only NWB but also the expanding NWB ecosystem. Additionally, the week was fantastic for connecting with others working on similar topics. I established potential collaborations and learned from people working on different topics as well.
- Carolina Filipe, Champalimaud Foundation

----------

NeuroDataReHack 2024 is a inspiring tour to the ecosystem that the NWB and DANDI has supported, including a set of useful tools, datasets, and example notebook to hand on. Great opportunities to meet the organizers that make those things happen, and to connect with other researchers interested in dataset reuse.
- Xinyue Ma, McGill University

----------

 The sessions on the DANDI archive and NWB format and accessible analysis tools were extremely helpful and made the tools fairly easy to use considering how powerful they are. The organizers and presenters did a great job breaking down complex topics and were really approachable and helpful throughout. Plus, getting to meet people from all over with similar interests was great. Big thanks to everyone who put this together – it was educational and fun.
 - Keith Van Antwerp, Georgia Tech

----------

NeuroDataReHack was a transformative experience. I left the hackathon inspired, equipped with new skills, and excited about the future of neuroscience. I highly recommend checking out the DANDI Archive, Neurodata Without Borders, and training opportunities like NeuroDataReHack for anyone looking to enhance the quality of their own research, promote the open exchange of neurodata, and contribute to the global success of neuroscience research.
- Megan Parsons, Neuroengineer
