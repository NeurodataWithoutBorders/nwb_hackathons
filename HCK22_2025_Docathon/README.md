## Dates and Location

- **Dates:** May 1-2, 2025
- **Location:** Virtual

## Objective

The [Neurodata Without Borders](nwb.org) project is an effort to standardize the description and storage of neurophysiology
data and metadata. NWB enables data sharing and reuse and reduces the energy barrier to applying data analytics both within
and across labs. NWB has seen wide adoption in the neurophysiology community, and there are now over 300 datasets on the
DANDI Archive in NWB, including data from the Allen Institute and the International Brain Laboratory.

One of the goals of NWB is to ensure that members of the neuroscience community have the resources and tools to easily 
interact with their data. We are hosting a dedicated docathon to invite members of the community to join us in updating, 
improving, and expanding our documentation. The goal of this workshp is to make sure our documentation is up-to-date and 
accessible to new and existing users of NWB.

Many types of contributions are welcome, including updates to:
* tutorials
* how-to guides
* docstrings
* user documentation
* developer documentation
* recorded demo videos

If you cannot attend but there is an a particular gap or aspect of the documentation you think could use improvement, 
please submit a documentation issue on the relevant GitHub repo.

**Note:** All levels of experience are welcome! We have several existing open issues and welcome new contributors.
