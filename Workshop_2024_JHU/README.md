# NWB and DANDI Workshop

### Hosted by the Kavli Neuroscience Discovery Institute at Johns Hopkins University

**Dates:** June 20-21, 2024

**Tentative Location:** [Clark Hall, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SUbwXYKHWnRGoRF97)

Join us for an interactive workshop on [Neurodata Without Borders (NWB)](https://nwb.org), a data standard for neurophysiology, and the [DANDI Archive](https://dandiarchive.org), a collaboration platform for publishing, sharing, and processing neurophysiology data. Learn how to use these resources to maximize the impact of your data while complying with the new NIH data sharing and management policies.

Representatives from the NWB and DANDI teams, Ben Dichter, Ryan Ly, and Stephanie Prince, will provide an overview of the NWB software ecosystem and teach you how to convert data to NWB and publish data on DANDI.

## Agenda

**Day 1: June 20, Lectures and Tutorials**

* **10:30 - 11:30:** Introduction to NWB and DANDI
  * Intro to Neurodata Without Borders (NWB)
  * Intro to DANDI Archive
  * NWB Extensions
  * Analysis and visualization tools
  * OpenScope DataBook
  * Other NWB Events
  * Download the GUIDE
* **11:30 - 12:** NWB GUIDE tutorial. Follow a self-paced walk-through of converting data to NWB and uploading to DANDI using the new NWB GUIDE application.
* **12 - 1:** Networking lunch
* **1 - 2:** Walk-through of NeuroConv, PyNWB and MatNWB. These software libraries
  provide more flexibility than the GUIDE app. This session will walk through their usage
  and tutorials.
* **2:00 – 2:30:** Interactive DANDI Demo. Explore the features of DANDI, including how to
  find and analyze datasets. Topics include:
  * Navigating DANDI
  * Neurosift
  * Search
  * DANDI Hub
* **2:30 - 2:45:** Break
* **2:45 – 3:30:** Interactive demos for analyzing data on DANDI Hub.
  * Analysis of open data from the Moser Lab in Python on DANDI Hub
  * Analysis of Dandiset 000011 in MATLAB on DANDI Hub
* **3:30 - 4:** Interactive demo of Dendro. Follow this self-paced tutorial to learn how to
    automatically run data processing apps in Dendro, a cloud-based data analysis application.
* **4 - 5:** BYOD (Bring Your Own Data) Hacking. Developers will be available for 1-1
  support.

**Day 2: June 21, Hackathon**

**10 AM - 4 PM:** BYOD (Bring Your Own Data) Hacking. Developers will be available
for 1-1 support. Targeted break-outs in a second room based on participant interest. Topics might include:
  * details on specific experiment modalities, 
  * building and using NWB extensions, or 
  * advanced data storage.
